82. Gene expression profile of human epidermal keratinocytes in response to IFNgamma, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17A and IL-22
(Submitter supplied) To understand the role of epidermal keratinocytes in immunopathology of skin diseases with predominant T helper (Th) cell responses, we measured the genome-wide transcriptional profile of human keratinocytes in response to IFNgamma, IL-4, IL-17A or IL-22, major cytokines produced by Th1, Th2, Th17 or Th22 cells, respectively. IL-6 was also included in the transcriptional profile analysis because a variety of pro-inflammatory stimuli stimulate human keratinocytes to produce IL-6 that has an autocrine or paracrine role in epidermal immunity.

(Submitter supplied) Hypoxia augments human embryonic stem cell self-renewal via hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α) activated OCT4 (POU5F1) transcription. Hypoxia also increases the efficiency of reprogramming differentiated cells to a pluripotent-like state. Combined, these findings suggest that low oxygen (O2) tension would impair the purposeful differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.  Here, we show that low O2 tension and HIF activity instead promotes appropriate hESC differentiation. more...

120. Epigenetic silencing of miR-210 increases the proliferation of gastric epithelium during chronic Helicobacter pylori infection
(Submitter supplied) Persistent colonization of the gastric mucosa by Helicobacter pylori (Hp) elicits chronic inflammation and aberrant epithelial cell proliferation, which increases the risk of gastric cancer. We examined the ability of microRNAs to modulate gastric cell proliferation in response to persistent Hp infection and found that epigenetic silencing of miR-210 plays a key role in gastric disease progression. Importantly, DNA methylation of the miR-210 gene was increased in Hp-positive human gastric biopsies as compared to Hp-negative controls. Moreover silencing of miR-210 in gastric epithelial cells promoted proliferation. We identified STMN1 and DIMT1 as miR-210 target genes and demonstrated that inhibition of miR-210 expression augmented cell proliferation by activating STMN1 and DIMT1. Together, our results highlight inflammation-induced epigenetic silencing of miR-210 as a mechanism of induction of chronic gastric diseases, including cancer, during Hp infection.

121. Melanoma cell acquired resistance to vinca-alkaloids
(Submitter supplied) Malignant melanoma (MM) remains a therapeutic challenge on account of extreme primary resistance to apoptosis and fated acquired chemoresistance. In the current context of molecular classification of MM, the understanding of molecular mechanisms giving rise to these resistances should drive therapeutic choice trough personalized medicine. In order to study mechanisms of MM acquire resistance to VAs, we previously established three VA-resistant cell lines, CAL1R-VCR, CAL1R-VDS, and CAL1R-VRB, by long time exposure of the CAL1-wt MM cell line to IC50 (4nM) of VCR, VDS and VRB respectively. more...

(Submitter supplied) Mocetinostat (MGCD) which is a kind of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) promotes human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiation towards neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Application of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) increased the expression of neuroectodermal markers once neural differentiation was initiated, thereby leading to more NPC generation. We used  microarrays to detail the global gene expression during NPC differentiaton upon MGCD treatment and identified the transcript changes effected by MGCD during this process.

159. Gene expression profiles of Siglec-14/THP-1 and Siglec-5/THP cell lines, with or without NTHi stimulation
(Submitter supplied) Acquisition of a new strain of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is often associated with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We have previously reported that COPD patients who are homozygous null for SIGLEC14 gene is less susceptible to COPD exacerbation than those who have wild-type allele with functional SIGLEC14 gene. In order to gain insight into the mechanism behind the COPD exacerbation, and to find new clues that may lead to the discovery of objective biomarker of COPD exacerbation, Siglec-14/THP-1 and Siglec-5/THP-1 cell lines, which mimic monocytes from homozygous wild-type and homozygous SIGLEC14-null person, respectively, were incubated with or without NTHi, and their gene expression profiles were compared by using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.

223. miR-28 expression in the Burkitt lymphoma cell line P3HR1
(Submitter supplied) Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), which originates from germinal center (GC) B cells and harbors translocations deregulating the MYC oncogene. A comparative analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed in normal and malignant GC B cells identified miR-28 as significantly down-regulated in BL, as well as in other GC-derived B-NHL. We show that re-expression of miR-28 impairs cell growth and clonogenic properties of BL cells by modulating several targets including MAD2L1, a component of the spindle checkpoint whose down-regulation is essential in mediating miR-28-induced growth-arrest, and BAG1, an activator of the ERK pathway.

Here we screen for genes required for maintaining the tumor stem cell phenotype and identify the zinc-finger transcription factor GATA6 as key regulator of the WNT and BMP pathways in CRC. GATA6 directly drives the expression of LGR5 in adenoma stem cells while it restricts BMP signaling to differentiated tumor cells. more...

241. Novel strategies to enforce an epithelial phenotype in mesenchymal cells
(Submitter supplied) E-cadherin downregulation in cancer cells is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic prowess, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely characterized. In this study, we probed E-cadherin expression at the plasma membrane as a functional assay to identify genes involved in E-cadherin downregulation. The assay was based on the E-cadherin-dependent invasion properties of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. more...

242. Inactivation of CDK2 is synthetic lethal to MYCN-overexpressing cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Two genes have a synthetic lethal relationship when silencing or inhibition of one gene is only lethal in the context of a mutation or activation of the second gene. This situation offers an attractive therapeutic strategy, as inhibition of such a gene will only trigger cell death in tumor cells with an activated second oncogene but spare normal cells without activation of the second oncogene. Here we present evidence that CDK2 is synthetic lethal to neuroblastoma cells with MYCN amplification and overexpression. more...

243. Expression data from human brain anterior cingulate cortex - including control samples and samples with major depression disorders (24 samples BA25_M)
(Submitter supplied) Major depressive disorder is a heterogeneous illness with a mostly uncharacterized pathology. Large scale gene expression (transcriptome) analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for single nucleotide polymorphisms have generated a considerable amount of gene- and disease-related information, but heterogeneity and various sources of noise have limited the discovery of disease mechanisms. As systematic dataset integration is becoming essential, we developed methods and performed meta-clustering of gene coexpression links in 11 transcriptome studies from postmortem brains of human subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and non-psychiatric control subjects. We next sought enrichment in the top 50 meta-analyzed coexpression modules for genes otherwise identified by GWAS for various sets of disorders. One coexpression module of 88 genes was consistently and significantly associated with GWAS for MDD, other neuropsychiatric disorders and brain functions, and for medical illnesses with elevated clinical risk of depression, but not for other diseases (See publication for details).

304. A signature predicting poor prognosis in gastric and ovarian cancer represents a coordinated macrophage and stromal-response.
(Submitter supplied) Genome wide mRNA expression profiling of 94 gastric tumours derived from Australian based cohort was performed. . From this data we identified a cluster of co-expressed genes termed the stromal response cluster which almost perfectly differentiates tumor from its non-malignant gastric tissue and hence can be regarded as a highly tumor-specific gene expression signature.  We show that these genes are consistently co-expressed across a range of independent gastric datasets as well as other cancer types suggesting a conserved functional role in cancer.

355. LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing wild-type or GARRPR-mutant Bag-1L
(Submitter supplied) The BF-3 pocket of the androgen receptor (AR) has been identified as an allosteric modulator of the transactivation function of the AR. We now demonstrate that a duplicated GARRPR motif at the N-terminus of the cochaperone Bag-1L functions through this BF-3 domain. Amino acid exchanges in these two motifs impair binding of Bag-1L to the AR but increase the androgen-dependent activation of a subset of AR-target genes. more...

362. Nuclear factor kappa B activation-induced anti-apoptosis renders HER2 positive cells drug resistant and accelerates tumor growth
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancers with HER2 overexpression are sensitive to drugs targeting the receptor or its kinase activity. HER2-targeting drugs are initially effective against HER2- positive breast cancer, but resistance inevitably occurs. We previously found that nuclear factor kappa B is hyper-activated in the subset of HER-2 positive breast cancer cells and tissue specimens. In this study, we report that constitutively active NF-κB rendered HER2-positive cancer cells resistant to anti-HER2 drugs, and cells selected for Lapatinib resistance up-regulated NF-κB. more...

419. β-catenin target genes in colorectal carcinoma cell lines with deregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling
(Submitter supplied) To validate the suitability of two commonly used colorectal cancer cell lines, DLD1 and SW480, as model systems to study colorectal carcinogenesis, we treated these cell lines with β-catenin siRNA and identified β-catenin target genes using DNA microarrays. The list of identified target genes was compared to previously published β-catenin target genes found in the PubMed and the GEO databases. Based on the large number of β-catenin target genes found to be similarly regulated in DLD1, SW480 and LS174T as well as the large overlap with confirmed β-catenin target genes, we conclude that DLD1 and SW480 colon carcinoma cell lines are suitable model systems to study β-catenin regulated genes and signaling pathways

433. Global Target mRNA Specification and Regulation by RNA-Binding Protein ZFP36/Tristetraprolin/TTP [Affymetrix]
(Submitter supplied) Tristetraprolin/ZFP36/TTP and ELAVL1/HuR are two disease-relevant RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that both interact with AU-rich sequences but have antagonistic roles. While ELAVL1 binding has been profiled in several studies, the precise in vivo binding specificity of ZFP36 has not been investigated on a global scale. We determined ZFP36 binding preferences using cross-linking and immunoprecipitation in human embyonic kidney cells and examined combinatorial regulation of AU-rich elements by ZFP36 and ELAVL1. more...

434. Inference and validation of predictive gene networks from biomedical literature and gene expression data
(Submitter supplied) Although many methods have been developed for inference of biological networks, the validation of the resulting models has largely remained an unsolved problem. Here we present a framework for quantitative assessment of inferred gene interaction networks using knock-down data from cell line experiments. Using this framework we are able to show that network inference based on integration of prior knowledge derived from the biomedical literature with genomic data significantly improves the quality of inferred networks relative to other approaches. more...

Aspirin is widely used to prevent cardiovascular events, though with variable results.  Therefore, we hypothesized that aspirin exposure would reveal novel biological pathways relevant to the development of cardiovascular events.  Methods: We administered aspirin, followed by peripheral blood RNA microarray profiling, in a discovery cohort of healthy volunteers (n = 50, HV1), followed by two validation cohorts of healthy volunteers (n = 53, HV2) or outpatient cardiology (OPC, n = 25) patients, in conjunction with platelet function testing with the platelet functions score (PFS, HV1 and HV2) or the VerifyNow Asprin (VN, OPC) test. more...

556. Gene Expression Across the Human Growth Plate
(Submitter supplied) Chondrocytes advance through the long bone growth plate in synchrony, allowing their segregation into one of four zones each corresponding to a different phase of maturation. Beginning from the epiphysis the recognized zones are: reserve, proliferative, prehypertrophic, and hypertrophic. A fifth zone, the perichondrium is located in apposition to the growth plate at its circumferential surface. The progression of chondrocytes through these zones, and hence growth, is regulated by a complex interplay of signaling pathways, defects in which lead to osteochondrodysplasias. more...

569. Expression data from N/Tert-HPV E6 cells in the presence and absence of mitomycin C treatment
(Submitter supplied) HPV E6 from the genus alpha 'high risk' types such as HPV16 recruit the ubiquitin ligase E6AP to ubiquitinate p53 and target it for proteasome-mediated degradation.  This results in the functional inactivation of p53 in HPV16-E6 expressing cells. To test what patterns in gene expression might change as a result of HPV16 E6 protein functions and to test whether HPV E6 proteins from genus beta virus types also inactivate p53, we profiled gene expression using Affymetrix arrays before and after stimulating p53 activity via DNA damage in a panel of N/Tert-E6 cell lines.

(Submitter supplied) We have analyzed, using DNA microarrays, putative differences in gene-expression level between hereditary BRCA1 mutation-linked and sporadic breast cancer. Our results show that a previously reported marked difference between BRCA1-mutation linked and sporadic breast cancer was probably due to uneven stratification of samples with different ER status and basal-like versus luminal-like subtype. We observed that apparent difference between BRCA1-linked and other types of breast cancer found in univariate analysis was diminished when data were corrected for ER status and molecular subtype in multivariate analyses. more...

590. Regulation of endometrial bleeding by uNK cells
(Submitter supplied) Uterine NK cells (uNK) play a role in the regulation of placentation but their functions in non-pregnant endometrium are not understood.  We have previously reported suppression of endometrial bleeding and alteration of spiral artery morphology in women exposed to asoprisnil, a progesterone receptor modulator (PRM).  We now compare global endometrial gene expression in asoprisnil-treated versus control women and demonstrate a statistically significant reduction of genes in the IL-15 pathway, known to play a key role in uNK development and function. more...

(Submitter supplied) NSD2, a histone lysine methyltransferase, is overexpressed as a result of the t(4;14) translocation that is associated with 15-20% of multiple myeloma. Earlier studies have indicated that NSD2 may be involved in myelomagenesis and suggested that it may be a target for myeloma therapy. Here we show that NSD2 is required for clonogenic growth, adherence and proliferation on bone marrow stroma, and tumorigenesis of t(4;14)+ but not t(4;14)- myeloma cells, in a methyltransferase activity dependent manner. more...

708. Expression data by telomere elongation in vivo (xenograft)
(Submitter supplied) Limitless reproductive potential is one of the hallmarks of cancer cells1. This ability is accomplished by maintaining telomeres, which erosion otherwise causes cellular senescence or death. Human cancer cells often maintain shorter telomeres than do cells in surrounding normal tissues2-5. While most cancer cells activate telomerase, which can elongate telomeres6, it remains elusive why cancer cells keep telomeres short. more...

709. Signaling pathways of HPAIV
(Submitter supplied) Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) induce severe inflammation in poultry and men. There is still an ongoing threat that these viruses may acquire the capability to freely spread as novel pandemic virus strains that may cause major morbidity and mortality. One characteristic of HPAIV infections is the induction of a cytokine burst that strongly contributes to viral pathogenicity. It has been suggested, that this cytokine overexpression is an intrinsic feature of infected cells and involves hyperinduction of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). more...

715. Expression data from immortalized human lung small airway epithelial cells
(Submitter supplied) In lung cancer progression, p53 mutations are more often observed in invasive tumors than in non-invasive tumors, suggesting that p53 is involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. To understand the nature of p53 function as a tumor suppressor, it is crucial to elucidate the detailed mechanism of the alteration in epithelial cells, the main origin of solid tumors, following p53 inactivation. To elucidate the mechanism by which p53 loss enhances invasive and motile activities in human lung small airway epithelial cells (SAECs), we performed comprehensive expression profiling analyses between p53 knockdown and control cells using GeneChip Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays.

Microarray analysis using human HeLa cells reveals knockdown of Thoc5 affects the expression of a subset of non-heat shock genes. Notably, depletion of Thoc5 attenuated the expression of the mRNAs polyadenylated at distal, but not proximal, polyadenylation sites, which phenocopied the depletion of CFIm68.

(Submitter supplied) Previously, we have shown that an AP-1 family member Fra-2, which is hardly expressed in normal mature T cells, is consistently over-expressed in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), and together with JunD, upregulates CCR4 and many other genes including proto-oncogenes c-Myb, MDM2, Bcl-6, and SOX4. SOX4 is frequently overexpressed in many solid tumors and considered to be a potential oncogene. To identify downstream target genes of SOX4 and analyze SOX4 oncogenic pathway in ATLL , we compared gene expression profiles of ST1 cells transfected with SOX4 siRNA or control siRNA using the Affymetrix high density oligonucleotide microarray.

Using a functional siRNA screen, we identified that the histone demethylase KDM4A played a critical role in the invasive growth and metastasis of SCC mediated by the Oncogenic MET. To investigate the molecular mechanism through which KDM4A inhibit the tumor cell invasion, we knock-down KDM4A in SCC23/MET cell and performed a gene microarray to examine which genes may be regulaged by kDM4A.

(Submitter supplied) Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, competitively binds and inhibits members of the TNF family, including Fas ligand (FasL), LIGHT, and TL1A. DcR3 was recently reported not only to act as a decoy receptor for these TNFRs but also to play a role as a ligand for the pathogenesis of RA. We hypothesized that DcR3 regulates the gene expression in RA-FLS. more...

807. Comparison of bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal cells from multiple myeloma patients and healthy donors
(Submitter supplied) It is now well established that bone marrow (BM) constitutes a microenvironment required for differentiation. Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) strongly support MM cell growth, by producing a high level of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a major MM cell growth factor. BM-MSCs also support osteoclastogenesis and angiogenesis. Previous studies have suggested that the direct (VLA-4, VCAM-1, CD44, VLA-5, LFA-1, syndecan-1,…) and indirect interactions (soluble factors) between MM plasma cells and BM-MSCs result in constitutive abnormalities in BM-MSCs. more...

(Submitter supplied) Mutations in both RAS and the PTEN/PIK3CA/AKT signaling module are found in the same human tumors. PIK3CA and AKT are downstream effectors of RAS, and the selective advantage conferred by mutation of two genes in the same pathway is unclear. Based on a comparative molecular analysis, we show that activated PIK3CA/AKT is a weaker inducer of senescence than is activated RAS. More-over, concurrent activation of RAS and PIK3CA/AKT impairs RAS-induced senescence. more...

(Submitter supplied) Purpose: In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) without retinoic acid receptor (RAR) rearrangement the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is still poorly understood despite an association of NPM1 mutation and ATRA response. Recently, PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma) has been shown to be a dominant repressor of RAR-signaling.   Experimental design: Thus, we further investigated ATRA response mechanisms, especially the impact of PRAME expression on ATRA-responsiveness by profiling gene expression in K562 cell lines. more...

(Submitter supplied) Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), a co-chaperone that organizes other chaperones- heat shock proteins (HSP), was recently shown to be secreted by human ovarian cancer cells to induce cell proliferation. In neuronal tissues, binding to prion protein was required for STIP1 to activate the ERK (extracellular regulated MAP kinase) signaling pathways. However, in this study, we found that STIP1 stimulated cell proliferation of ovarian cancer via a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, not through the prion-ERK pathway. more...

827. Macrophage Microvesicles Induce Macrophage Differentiation and miR-223 Transfer
(Submitter supplied) Microvesicles (MV) are small membrane-bound particles comprised of exosomes and various sized extracellular vesicles. These are released by a number of cell types. Microvesicles have a variety of cellular functions from communication to mediating growth and differentiation. Microvesicles contain proteins and nucleic acids. Previously, we showed that plasma microvesicles contain microRNAs (miRNAs). Based on our previous report, the majority of peripheral blood microvesicles are derived from platelets while mononuclear phagocytes, including macrophages, are the second most abundant population. more...

829. Gene expression analysis of human CD4+ T cells differentiated into Th17 cells in the presence of high-salt
(Submitter supplied) Th17 cells are believed to be a critical cell population for driving autoimmune diseases. However, environmental factors that are directly related to the development of Th17 cells are largely unknown. High-salt (NaCl) concentrations enhance Th17 differentiation of human naive CD4+ T cells in vitro. The aim of the study was to analyse the changes in gene expression induced by high-salt conditions during Th17 differentiation.

870. Transcriptional analysis of cervical epithelial cell responses to HIV-1
(Submitter supplied) HIV-1 infections of women are mainly acquired through female reproductive tract where cervical and vaginal epithelial cells are the first line of defense. Although HIV-1 does not directly infect epithelial cells, HIV-1 obligatorily interacts with and crosses over epithelial layer to infect susceptible target cells, mainly CD4+ T cells, in the lamina propria to initiate an infection. However, the mechanism and ramification of the interaction of HIV-1 and epithelial cells in vaginal transmission of HIV-1 remain to be elucidated. more...

872. Gene expression profiling of cidofovir treatment and resistance in SiHa cells
(Submitter supplied) Cidofovir is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with strong antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of DNA viruses. Although it has previously been shown that cidofovir exerts an antiproliferative effect on HPV positive cells by the induction of apoptosis, the exact mechanism of action remains to be unraveled. In order to study the activity of cidofovir against HPV, gene expression profiling was performed in cidofovir-treated and cidofovir-resistant SiHa cells by means of microarrays (HG-U133 Plus 2, Affymetrix).

875. Gene expression analysis of human fetal liver hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) in culture
(Submitter supplied) One of the long-standing goals in the field has been to establish a culture system that would allow maintenance of HSC properties ex vivo. In the absence of such system, the ability to model human hematopoiesis in vitro has been limited, and there has been little progress in the expansion of human HSCs for clinical application. To that end, we defined a mesenchyml stem cell co-culture system for expansion of clonally multipotent human HSPCs that are protected from apoptosis and immediate differentiation, and retain the HSPC phenotype. more...

878. Identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase as a candidate of new therapeutic target for BCC
(Submitter supplied) Background; Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cancer in humans.  The pathogenesis of BCC is associated with the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway.  Vismodegib, a smoothened inhibitor, that targets this pathway is now in clinical use for advanced BCC patients, but its efficacy is limited.  Therefore, new therapeutic options for this cancer are required.  Methods; We studied gene expression profiling of BCC tumour tissue coupled with laser capture microdissection to identify tumor specific receptor tyrosine kinase expression that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors. more...

880. HIPK2 and MED19 are new regulators of androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) The androgen receptor (AR) is a mediator of both androgen-dependent and castration- resistant prostate cancers.  Identification of cellular factors affecting AR transcriptional activity could in principle yield new targets that reduce AR activity and combat prostate cancer, yet a comprehensive analysis of the genes required for AR-dependent transcriptional activity has not been determined.  Using an unbiased genetic approach that takes advantage of the evolutionary conservation of AR signaling, we have conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila cells for genes required for AR transcriptional activity and applied the results to human prostate cancer cells. more...

886. Transcriptional profiles of TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 A549 overexpressing cells and in tumor xenografts.
(Submitter supplied) TIMP-2 is an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, i.e. inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. As a result, TIMP-2 inhibits tumor growth and progression to metastasis. Understanding, therefore, the mechanisms of TIMP-2-mediated tumor growth inhibition would provide further support on the use of TIMP-2 as a novel biological agent for cancer therapy. We used microarray analysis to determine the TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 transcriptional profiles of A549 cancer cells in order to understand how TIMP-2 inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis.

909. JAG1 is an Invasion and Metastasis promoting genes of Lung cancer
(Submitter supplied) Background: JAG-1 is a ligand of Notch signaling and can regulate cell differentiation and proliferation in cancers. Recent studies indicated that JAG1 is a gene associated with cancer progression. Therefore, we investigated the role of JAG1 in lung cancer progression. Methods: The expression of JAG1 was manipulated by overexpression or RNA silencing in several human lung cell lines. The effect of JAG1 on tumorigenesis and invasion was assessed by the cell anchorage-independent growth, cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion assays in vitro as well as metastasis in vivo. more...

(Submitter supplied) We recently reported an oncogenomics-guided screening approach designed to identify genetic drivers of early stage melanoma metastasis, and in this study we functionally validate the top-scoring candidate, homeobox transcription factor A1 (HOXA1), by demonstrating HOXA1‘s robust effects on melanoma cell invasion, metastasis and tumorigenicity.  Transcriptome and pathway profiling analyses of cells expressing HOXA1 reveal up-regulation of factors involved in diverse cytokine pathways that include the TGFβ signaling axis, which we further demonstrate to be required for HOXA1-mediated cell invasion. more...

948. Comparative gene expression in the human limbus, conjunctiva and cornea
(Submitter supplied) To date, there is no specific marker for limbal epithelial stem cells. The identification of a marker that is expressed in the limbal epithelium but not in the cornea or conjunctiva epithelium has been a growing need. To search for limbal-specific marker(s), we performed preferential gene profiling in the limbus in direct comparison to that in the cornea and conjunctiva using microarray technique.

951. Genome-wide expression profiling of laser micro-dissected macrophages from ruptured and stable atherosclerotic human plaques
(Submitter supplied) Objective: Resident macrophages play an important role in atheromatous plaque rupture.  The macrophage gene expression signature associated with plaque rupture is incompletely defined due to the complex cellular heterogeneity in the plaque. We aimed to characterise differential gene expression in resident plaque macrophages from ruptured and stable human atheromatous lesions. A cell-specific approach has the potential to address the question of gene expression differences between particular cell types in stable and unstable plaques with greater precision than approaches based on the study of whole plaques. more...

952. Alterations of methylome and transcriptome in human melanoma: the inverse relationship between epigenome integrity and BRAF mutation
(Submitter supplied) Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer with rising incidence and mortality rates. Oncogenic mutation in BRAF gene is the single most frequent genetic alteration in human melanoma; however, this event per se is not sufficient to produce melanoma in vivo. We have investigated whether epigenetic changes, specifically aberrant DNA methylation and dysregulation of gene expression, alone or in combination with this genetic event, are involved in the genesis of human melanoma. more...

958. Profiling of p53-responsive genes in human breast cancer cells harboring endogenous ts-p53 E285K
(Submitter supplied) The ts-p53 E285K protein is a rare p53 mutant with temperature-sensitive (ts) loss of function characteristics. In cancer cells, which express ts-p53 E285K intriniscally, endogenous wild type p53 activity is reconstituted by appropriate cultivation temperature (permissive condition). At non-appropriate cultivation temperature (restrictive condition) this p53 mutant is inactive. The present study took advantage of this mechanism and employed IPH-926 lobular breast cancer cells and BT-474 ductal breast cancer cells, which both harbor endogenous ts-p53 E285K, for the transcriptional profiling of p53-responsive genes. more...

988. Smoking is Associated with Shortened Airway Cilia
(Submitter supplied) Background: Whereas cilia damage and reduced cilia beat frequency have been implicated as causative of reduced mucociliary clearance in smokers, theoretically mucociliary clearance could also be affected by cilia length. Based on models of mucociliary clearance predicting cilia length must exceed the 6 -7 μm airway surface fluid depth to generate force in the mucus layer, we hypothesized cilia height may be decreased in airway epithelium of normal smokers compared to nonsmokers. more...

1065. Expression data from HeLa cells treated with Casiopeina Cas-II-gly
(Submitter supplied) Copper-based chemotherapeutic compounds Casiopeinas, have been presented as able to promote selective programmed cell death in cancer cells, thus being proper candidates for targeted cancer therapy. DNA fragmentation and apoptosis -in a process mediated by reactive oxygen species- for a number of tumor cells, have been argued to be the main mechanisms. However, a detailed functional mechanism (a model) is still to be defined and interrogated for a wide variety of cellular conditions; before establishing settings and parameters needed for their wide clinical application. more...

1068. Correlated alterations in genome organization, histone methylation, and DNA-lamina interactions in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (expression)
(Submitter supplied) Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a premature aging disease that is frequently caused by a de novo point mutation at position 1824 in LMNA. This mutation activates a cryptic splice donor site in exon 11, and leads to an in-frame deletion within the prelamin A mRNA and the production of a dominant negative lamin A protein, known as progerin. Here we show that HGPS cells experience genome-wide alterations in patterns of H3K27me3 deposition, changes in the associations of genomic loci with nuclear lamin A/C, and, at late passages, genome-wide loss of spatial compartmentalization of active and inactive chromatin domains that characterizes chromosome folding in normal cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Mutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) occur in a variety of tumor types, resulting in production of the proposed oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). How mutant IDH and 2-HG alter signaling pathways to promote cancer, though, remains unclear. Additionally, there exist relatively few cell lines with IDH mutations. To examine the effect of endogenous IDH mutations and 2-HG, we created a panel of isogenic epithelial cell lines with either wild-type IDH1/2 or clinically relevant IDH1/2 mutations. more...

(Submitter supplied) We demonstrated recently that both constitutive and FAS-triggered apoptosis of human neutrophils are profoundly impaired by Francisella tularensis, but how this is achieved is largely unknown.   To test the hypothesis that changes in neutrophil gene expression contribute to this phenotype, we used human oligonucleotide microarrays to identify differentially regulated genes in cells infected with F. tularensis strain LVS compared with uninfected controls. In order to examine the effect of F. tularensis on the neutrophil transcriptome, we performed microarray expression analysis on human neutrophils treated with F. tularensis subsp. holarctica live vaccine strain (LVS).

1081. DNA damage and eIF4G1 in breast cancer cells reprogram translation for survival and DNA repair mRNAs
(Submitter supplied) The cellular response to DNA damage is mediated through multiple pathways that regulate and coordinate DNA repair, cell cycle arrest  and cell death. We show that the DNA damage response (DDR) induced by ionizing radiation (IR) is coordinated in breast cancer  cells by selective mRNA translation mediated by high levels of translation initiation factor eIF4G1. Increased expression of eIF4G1,  common in breast cancers, was found to selectively increase translation of mRNAs involved in cell survival and the DDR, preventing  autophagy and apoptosis (Survivin, HIF1α, XIAP), promoting cell cycle arrest (GADD45a, p53, ATRIP, Chk1) and DNA repair (53BP1,  BRCA1/2, PARP, Rfc2-5, ATM, MRE-11, others). more...

1104. Control of Somatic Tissue Differentiation by the Long Non-Coding RNA TINCR (array)
(Submitter supplied) Several of the thousands of human long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been functionally characterized; however, potential roles  for lncRNAs in somatic tissue differentiation remain poorly understood. Here we show that a 3.7kb lncRNA,  terminal differentiation-induced  ncRNA (TINCR), controls human epidermal differentiation by a post-transcriptional mechanism. TINCR is required for high mRNA abundance of key differentiation genes, many of which are mutated in human skin diseases, including  FLG, LOR, ALOXE3, ALOX12B, ABCA12, CASP14 and ELOVL3. more...

1106. Timecourse gene expression profiling of DLBCL cell line Karpas422 after EZH2 inhibitor treatment
(Submitter supplied) Ezh2 protein is the enzymatic component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC)-2, which represses its target genes by methylating lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) and regulates cell proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development. Recently, hot-spot mutations of Ezh2 have been identified in diffused large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and follicular lymphomas (FLs). To investigate if tumor growth is dependent on the enzymatic activity of Ezh2, we have developed a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor, EI1, which inhibits the enzymatic activity of Ezh2 through direct binding and competing with the methyl group donor S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM). more...

(Submitter supplied) ACSL4 expression appears to be inversely associated with steroid hormone and growth factor receptor expression in breast cancer and positively correlated with an aggressive breast cancer phenotype.  Neither MCF-7 nor SKBr3 cells normally express ACSL4, and when manipulated to do so, develop basal-like characteristics, including increased proliferation, migration and anchorage independent growth.  We used an Affymetrix array platform to assess changes in individual gene expression as a function of conditional and stable expression of ACSL4 in MCF-7 and SKBr3 cells.

1137. Analyzing primary Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells to capture the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma
(Submitter supplied) The pathogenesis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), the most common lymphoma in the young, is still enigmatic, largely because its Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) tumor cells are rare in the involved lymph node and therefore difficult to analyze. Here, by overcoming this technical challenge and performing for the first time a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of microdissected HRS cells in comparison to other B-cell lymphomas, cHL lines and normal B-cell subsets, we show that they differ extensively from the usually studied cHL cell lines, that the lost B-cell identity of cHLs is not linked to the acquisition of a plasma cell-like gene expression program, and that Epstein-Barr virus infection of HRS cells has a minor transcriptional influence on the established cHL clone. more...

1143. Expression analysis of uncultured and culture-derived colony forming unit-monocytes and megakaryocytes
(Submitter supplied) The cellular composition of heterogeneous samples can be predicted from reference gene expression profiles that represent the homogeneous, constituent populations of the heterogeneous samples. However, existing methods fail when the reference profiles are not representative of the constituent populations. We developed PERT, a new probabilistic expression deconvolution method, to address this limitation. more...

1144. A phase II study of adding the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib to endocrine therapy in patients with metastatic ER-positive breast cancer.
(Submitter supplied) Growth factor signaling and angiogenesis may promote endocrine-resistance in breast cancer and blocking these pathways can overcome resistance in preclinical models.  We conducted a phase-II study of adding the VEGFR/Ras/Raf/MAPK inhibitor sorafenib to endocrine therapy in metastatic ER-positive breast cancer, either upon progression or after maximal response with measurable residual disease. Tumor biopsies and serum were collected on days 1 and 28. more...

1147. Gene expression of differentiating hESCs into otic progenitors
(Submitter supplied) Stem cells, with their potential to generate different lineages, could offer a solution by replacing damaged or lost cells within the inner ear. We have shown that human embryonic stem cells can be induced to differentiate into otic progenitors, and then into hair cell-like cells and neurons that display expected electrophysiological properties. More importantly, once these otic progenitors are transplanted into animals with induced hearing loss, they differentiate and elicit a significant recovery of auditory function. more...

1181. Network Biology of Tumor Stem-like Cells Identified a Regulatory Role of CBX5 in Lung Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Mounting evidence points to a link between a cancer possessing stem-like properties and a worse prognosis. To understand the biology, a common approach is to integrate network biology with signal processing mechanics. That said, even with the right tools, predicting the risk for a highly susceptible target using only a handful of gene signatures remains very difficult. By compiling the expression profiles of a panel of tumor stem-like cells (TSLCs) originating in different tissues, comparing these to their parental tumor cells (PTCs) and the human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and integrating network analysis with signaling mechanics, we propose that network topologically-weighted signaling processing measurements under tissue-specific conditions can provide scalable and predicable target identification. more...

1182. Culturing Cytotrophoblasts Reverses Gene Dysregulation in Preeclampsia Revealing Possible Causes
(Submitter supplied) During human pregnancy, a subset of placental cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) differentiates into cells that aggressively invade the uterus and its vasculature, anchoring the progeny and rerouting maternal blood to the placenta. In preeclampsia (PE), CTB invasion is limited, reducing placental perfusion and/or creating intermittent flow. This syndrome, affecting 4-8% of pregnancies, entails maternal vascular alterations (e.g., high blood pressure, proteinuria, and edema) ± fetal growth restriction. more...

1184. Expression profiling of host genes altered after chemical-induced recurrent Epstein-Barr virus reactivation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells
(Submitter supplied) Seroepidemiological studies imply a correlation between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation and the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Phorbol esters, butyrates and N-nitroso compounds are known chemical carcinogens in foodstuffs and cigarettes that have been implicated as risk factors contributing to the development of NPC. We have demonstrated previously that low dose N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG, 0.1 microg/ml) had a synergistic effect with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and sodium butyrate (SB) in enhancing EBV reactivation (Chem Biol Interact 188: 623-634). more...

1221. Suppression of major attributes of tumor-initiating cells through epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(Submitter supplied) Malignant progression in cancer has been associated with the emergence of populations of tumor-initiating cells (TIC) endowed with capabilities for unlimited self-renewal, survival under stress and establishment of distant metastases. Additionally, the acquisition of invasive properties driven by the genetic program known as epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) may be an essential step in the evolution of neoplastic cells into fully metastatic populations. more...

1222. EMT inducers catalyze malignant transformation of mammary epithelial cells and drive tumorigenesis towards claudin-low tumors [human]
(Submitter supplied) The newly identified claudin-low subtype of cancer is believed to represent the most primitive breast malignancies, having arisen from transformation of an early epithelial precursor with inherent stemness properties and metaplastic features. Challenging this hypothesis, we show both in vitro and in vivo that transcription factors inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition can drive the development of claudin-low tumors from differentiated mammary epithelial cells, by playing a dual role in cell transformation and dedifferentiation.

(Submitter supplied) Abstract: Epigenetic alterations are a fundamental aspect of cancer cells, and epigenetic drugs are currently used in clinical practice for hematological malignancies. Pediatric neuro-ectodermal tumors originate from neural crest cells and show epigenetic defects of apoptotic pathways, which makes the introduction of epigenetic drugs in this patient category logical. However, the young age of these patients is accompanied by ongoing developmental processes which are regulated epigenetic mechanisms, and prompted us to study molecular effects of nanomolar dosage epigenetic drugs in neuro-ectodermal tumor cell lines. more...

(Submitter supplied) The LEF/TCF family of transcription factors are downstream effectors of the WNT signaling pathway, which drives colon tumorigenesis.  LEF/TCFs have a DNA sequence-specific HMG box that binds Wnt Response Elements (WREs).  The “E tail” isoforms of TCFs are alternatively spliced to include a second DNA binding domain called the C-clamp.  We show that induction of a dominant negative C-clamp version of TCF1 (dnTCF1E) induces a p21-dependent stall in the growth of DLD1 colon cancer cells. more...

1306. Oncogenic Activation Of FOXR1 by 11q23 Intrachromosomal Deletion-Fusions In Neuroblastoma
(Submitter supplied) Neuroblastoma tumors frequently show loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 11q with a shortest region of overlap in the 11q23 region.  These deletions are thought to cause inactivation of tumor suppressor genes leading to haploinsufficiency.  Alternatively, micro-deletions could lead to gene fusion products that are tumor-driving.  To identify such events we analyzed a series of neuroblastomas by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and integrated these data with Affymetrix mRNA profiling data with the bioinformatic tool R2 (http://r2.amc.nl). more...

(Submitter supplied) Abstract. The role of platelets in hemostasis and thrombosis is clearly established; however, the mechanisms by which platelets mediate inflammatory and immune pathways are less well understood.  Platelets interact and modulate the function of blood and vascular cells by releasing bioactive molecules. Although the platelet is anucleate, it contains transcripts that may mirror disease.  Platelet mRNA is only associated with low-level protein translation, however, platelets have a unique membrane structure allowing for the passage of small molecules, leading to the possibility that its’ cytoplasmic RNA may be passed to nucleated cells. more...

1335. The gamma secretase inhibitor MRK-003 attenuates pancreatic cancer growth in preclinical models
(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a nearly uniformly lethal malignancy, with most patients facing an adverse clinical outcome.  Given the pivotal role of aberrant Notch signaling in the initiation and progression of PDAC, we investigated the effect of MRK-003, a potent and selective γ-secretase inhibitor, in preclinical PDAC models.  We used a panel of human PDAC cell lines, as well as patient-derived PDAC xenografts, to determine whether pharmacological targeting of the Notch pathway could inhibit pancreatic tumor growth and potentiate gemcitabine sensitivity. more...

(Submitter supplied) Biallelic mutations of the DNA annealing helicase SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF-related  matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1) cause  Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD, MIM 242900), an incompletely penetrant  autosomal recessive disorder. Using human, Drosophila, and mouse models, we show  that the proteins encoded by SMARCAL1 orthologues localize to transcriptionally active  chromatin and modulate gene expression. more...

1372. Krüppel-like Factor 9 and Progesterone Receptor Co-Regulation of Decidualizing Endometrial Stromal Cells: Implications for its Loss in the Pathogenesis of Endometriosis
(Submitter supplied) Endometriosis is characterized by progesterone resistance and is associated with infertility. Krüppel-like Factor 9 (KLF9) is a progesterone receptor (PGR)-interacting protein, and mice null for Klf9 are subfertile. Whether loss of KLF9 contributes to progesterone resistance of eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate KLF9 and PGR co-regulation of human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) transcriptome network.

It most often arises in salivary glands and other secretory glands in the head and neck region. To find the gene expression signatures of ACC, we performed microarray experiments to compare ACC xenograft tumor models and normal tissue samples. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying adenoid cystic carcinoma and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes compared to non-neoplastic salivary tissue.

1446. A transcriptional map of the impact of endurance exercise training on skeletal muscle phenotype (resting muscle after endurance training)
(Submitter supplied) The molecular pathways which are activated and contribute to physiological remodeling of skeletal muscle in response to endurance exercise have not been fully characterized. We previously reported that ~800 gene transcripts are regulated following 6 weeks of supervised endurance training in young sedentary males, referred to as the training responsive transcriptome (TRT). Here we utilized this database together with data on biological variation in muscle adaptation to aerobic endurance training in both humans and a novel out-bred rodent model to study the potential regulatory molecules that coordinate this complex network of genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) In an effort to understand the mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors, we isolated clones that acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor GSK2118436 derived from the A375 BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell line. This resistance clones acquired mutations in NRAS and MEK1. One clones, 16R6-4, acquired two mutations in NRAS – Q61K and A146T. Proliferation and western blot analyses demonstrated that these clones were insensitive to single agent GSK2118436 or GSK1120212 (an allosteric MEK inhibitor) but were sensitive to the combination of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212. more...

(Submitter supplied) Tumours contain heterogeneous cell populations. A population enriched in tumour-initiating potential has been identified in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) by the isolation of side population (SP) cells. In this study, we compared the gene expression profiles of SP and non-SP cells in STS and identified Hedgehog (Hh) and Notch pathways as potential candidates for the targeting of SP cells. Upon verification of the activation of these pathways in SP cells, using primary tumor xenografts in NOD-SCID mice as our experimental model, we used the Hh blocker Triparanol and the Notch blocker DAPT to demonstrate that the suppression of these pathways effectively depleted the abundance of SP cells, reduced tumour growth, and inhibited the tumour-initiating potential of the treated sarcoma cells upon secondary transplantation. more...

1605. Gene expression analysis of osteosarcoma tumor-initiating cells (High) vs bulk tumor cells (Low)
(Submitter supplied) In the cancer stem cell model a cell hierarchy has been suggested as an explanation for intratumoral heterogeneity, and tumor formation is thought to be driven by this tumor cell subpopulation. The identification of cancer stem cells in osteosarcoma (OS) and the biological processes dysregulated in this cell subpopulation, also known as tumor-initiating cells (TICs), may provide new therapeutic targets. more...

1609. mRNAs associated with human DAZ-interacting protein (DZIP1)
(Submitter supplied) DZIP (DAZ-Interacting Protein) containing a C2H2 zinc-finger domain is expressed predominantly in human embryonic stem cells and fetal and adult germ cells; DZIP colocalizes with DAZ and/or DAZL proteins in these tissues. DZIP may associate with DAZ and its other cofactors in an RNA-binding protein complex that functions in both embryonic stem cells and germ cells. To identify mRNAs associated with human DZIP1 protein in HeLa cells, we used a modified Ribonucleoprotein-ImmunoPrecipitation Microarray (RIP-Chip).DZIP1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes were performed with 2 µg of anti-DZIP1 antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) bound to protein A-agarose beads (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). more...

1610. 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography marks MYC-overexpressing human basal-like breast cancers.
(Submitter supplied) Fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is widely used as positron-emission-tomography (PET) radiotracer for the detection and staging of human cancer. Tumor uptake of FDG varies substantially between different cancer types and between patients with the same tumor type. The molecular basis for this heterogeneity is unknown. Using cancer cell lines and primary human tumors of distinct histologic origins, we here show that increased FDG uptake is universally associated with coordinate upregulation of genes within the glycolysis, pentose-phosphate, and other related metabolic pathways. more...

1644. An eight-gene expression signature for the prediction of survival and time to treatment in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(Submitter supplied) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common and heterogeneous disease. An accurate prediction of outcome is highly relevant for the development of personalized treatment strategies. Microarray technology was shown to be a useful tool for the development of prognostic gene expression scores. However, there are no gene expression scores which are able to predict overall survival in CLL based on the expression of few genes that are better than established prognostic markers. more...

1645. Expression analysis of genes located in the minimally deleted regions of 13q14 and 11q22-23 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia – unexpected expression pattern of the RHO GTPase activator ARHGAP20
(Submitter supplied) In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 13q14 and 11q22-23 deletions are found in 2/3 of the cases. 11q22-23 deletions are associated with poor survival, whereas 13q14 deletions as single abnormality are often found in indolent disease forms. The molecular basis for this difference in prognosis is not known. ARHGAP20 encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein. In the zebra fish (Danio rerio) genome the syntenic regions of human chromosomal bands 13q14 and 11q22-23 are juxtaposed. more...

1646. In vitro prednisolone resistance signature in MLL-rearranged infant ALL
(Submitter supplied) Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in infants (<1 year of age) is characterized by a high incidence of MLL translocations which is associated with a poor prognosis. Contributing to this poor prognosis is cellular drug resistance, especially to glucocorticoids like prednisolone. Although in vitro prednisolone resistance mechanisms have been proposed in pediatric ALL, it has never been studied in MLL-rearranged infant ALL, which are highly resistant to glucocorticoids in vitro and in vivo.

1654. Autism and increased paternal age related changes in global levels of gene expression regulation
(Submitter supplied) A causal role of mutations in genes encoding for multiple general transcription factors in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism suggested that alterations at the global level of gene expression regulation might also relate to disease risk in sporadic cases of autism. This premise can be tested by evaluating for global changes in the overall distribution of gene expression levels. For instance, in mice, we recently showed that variability in hippocampal-dependent behaviors was associated with variability in the pattern of the overall distribution of gene expression levels, as assessed by variance in the distribution of gene expression levels in the hippocampus. more...

1685. Microarray analysis of genes associated with cell surface NIS protein levels in breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Na+/I- symporter (NIS)-mediated iodide uptake allows radioiodine therapy for thyroid cancer.  NIS is also expressed in breast tumors, raising potential for radionuclide therapy of breast cancer.  However, NIS expression in most breast cancers is low and may not be sufficient for radionuclide therapy.  A better understanding of the mechanisms of NIS regulation in breast cancer may lead to strategies for increasing cell surface NIS and radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) in breast cancer. more...

With this in mind, we previously established a protocol that facilitates the differentiation of both human embryonic stem cells and induced pluritpotent cells into cells with hepatocyte characteristics. The use of highly defined culture conditions and the avoidance of feeder cells or embryoid bodies allowed synchronous and reproducible differentiation to occur. more...

1728. Endogenous expression of an oncogenic PI3K mutation leads to activated PI3K pathway signaling and an invasive phenotype
(Submitter supplied) The PTEN/PI3K pathway is commonly mutated in cancer and therefore represents a rational target for therapeutic intervention. In order to investigate the primary phenotype(s) mediated by mutant PIK3CA in a clean and highly patient-relevant context, we utilized a non-tumorigenic MCF10A parental and isogenic knock-in cell line that harbors a common activating PIK3CA kinase domain mutation (H1047R). We found that introduction of an endogenously mutated PIK3CA primarily results in a marked epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasive phenotype compared to isogenic wild-type cells. more...

1731. Gene expression analysis of human pediatric mesenchymal stem cells (hpMSCs) upon expression of EWS-FLI-1
(Submitter supplied) Cancer stem cells (CSCs) display plasticity and self-renewal properties reminiscent of normal tissue stem cells, but the events responsible for their emergence remain obscure. We recently identified CSCs in Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs) and showed that they retain mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) plasticity. In the present study, we addressed the mechanisms that underlie ESFT CSC development. We show that the EWS-FLI-1 fusion gene, associated with 85%-90% of ESFTs and believed to initiate their pathogenesis, induces expression of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) genes OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in human pediatric MSCs (hpMSCs) but not in their adult counterparts. more...

1784. PHD finger recognition of unmodified histone H3R2 links UHRF1 to regulation of euchromatic gene expression
(Submitter supplied) Histone methylation occurs on both lysine and arginine residues and its dynamic regulation plays a critical role in chromatin biology. Here we identify the UHRF1 PHD domain (PHDUHRF1), an important regulator of DNA CpG methylation, as an unanticipated histone H3 unmodified arginine 2 (H3R2)-recognition modality. This conclusion is based on binding studies and co-crystal structures of the PHDUHRF1 bound to histone H3 peptides, where the guanidinium group of unmodified R2 forms an extensive intermolecular hydrogen bond network, with methylation of H3R2, but not H3K4 or H3K9, disrupting complex formation. more...

1807. Expression of HOXB genes is significantly different in acute myeloid leukemia with a partial tandem duplication of MLL vs. a MLL translocation: a cross-laboratory study
(Submitter supplied) In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene may be rearranged to generate a partial tandem duplication (PTD), or fused to partner genes through a chromosomal translocation (tMLL). In this study, we first explored the differentially expressed genes between MLL-PTD and tMLL using gene expression profiling of our cohort (15 MLL-PTD and 10 tMLL) and one published data set. The top 250 probes were chosen from each set, resulting in 29 common probes (21 unique genes) to both sets. more...

1809. Expression in Huh7 cells 72 hours after treatment with scramble, SPTLC123, or DEGS siRNA
(Submitter supplied) Dysregulation of ceramide synthesis has been associated with metabolic disorders such as atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus. Using a human hepatoma cell line (Huh7), we investigated the changes in lipid homeostasis and gene expression when the synthesis of ceramide is perturbed by knocking down serine transferases subunits 1, 2 and 3 (SPTLC123) or dihydroceramide desaturase (DEGS1). While the inhibition of serine palmitoyl transferase (SPTLC) affects ceramide production differently at the subspecies level depending upon which SPTLC subunit is silenced; depleting DEGS1 is sufficient to produce a similar outcome as knocking down all SPTLC subunits. more...

1841. Comparison of the RNA expression profile between P-cadherin over-expressing BLM melanoma cells and empty-vector control cells
(Submitter supplied) Van Marck et al. (Cancer Research, 2005) published that overexpression of P-cadherin in a melanoma cell line promoted homo- and heterotypic cell-cell adhesion, induced an epitheloïd morphology, and impaired cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we wanted to compare the RNA expression profile between the empty vector control cells and the P-cadherin overexpression variant. This experiment could provide us with effector molecules of P-cadherin that mediate its anti-invasive function.

Therefore the capability to detect the morbidity initiation with an sensitive and effective approach is one of the most desirable goals for curing ovarian cancer. In this study, we used microarray technology for salivary mRNA biomarkers discovery, and evaluated the performance and translational utilities of discovered markers from a clinical study using an independent sample cohort . more...

1877. The Notch/Hes1 pathway sustains NF-κB activation through CYLD repression in T cell leukemia
(Submitter supplied) The NF-κB pathway is a critical regulator of the immune system and has been implicated in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. NF-κB response is regulated by the activation state of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex and triggered by a wide spectrum of stimuli. We previously reported that NF-κB is downstream of Notch1 in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), however both the mechanisms involving Notch1-induced NF-κB activation and the potential importance of NF-κB in the maintenance of the disease are unknown. more...

1885. Host Factors with Reduced Expression in Two HCV Permissive Cell Lines as Compared to the Non-Permissive Parent Cell Line Huh7
(Submitter supplied) Drugs directly targeting Hepatitis C (HCV) are often rendered useless by the high mutation rate of the virus. Thus, we deduce that targeting of host factor that affect HCV replication may provide enhanced therapy fort HCV infection. Hepatocyte cell line Huh7 is known to be non-permissive for Hepatits C (HCV) replication.  Through a method developed by the Rice laboratory (Blight, K.J.,  et al., J Virol, 2002), selection of a small subset of permissive hepatocytes is possible. more...

The effect of hypoxia on gene expression in adipocytes seems to play a central role in this inflammatory response observed in obesity. However, the global impact of hypoxia on transcriptional changes in human adipocytes is unclear. Therefore, we compared gene expression profiles of human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes under normoxic or hypoxic conditions to detect hypoxia-responsive genes in adipocytes by using whole human genome microarrays.

1913. Characterization of differential gene expression in adrenocortical tumors harbouring β-catenin  (CTNNB1) mutations.
(Submitter supplied) Mutations of β-catenin gene (CTNNB1) are frequent in adrenocortical adenomas (AA) and carcinomas (ACC). However, the target genes of CTNNB1 have not yet been identified in adrenocortical tumors. Our objective was to identify genes de-regulated in adrenocortical tumors harbouring CTNNB1 genetic alterations.

1914. Expression data from LNCap cell line treated with COP1 (RFWD2), ETV1, and JUN siRNAs
(Submitter supplied) The proto-oncogenes ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5 encode members of the E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor family, which includes the most frequently rearranged and overexpressed genes in prostate cancer.  Despite being critical regulators of development, little is known about their post-translational regulation.  Here we identify the ubiquitin ligase COnstitutive Photomorphogenic-1 (COP1, also called RFWD2) as a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5. more...

1915. Deciphering the Cancer Cell Resistome: Gene and microRNA Expression Signatures reveal Unique Molecular Targets for Therapeutic Intervention in Etoposide Resistant Breast Cancer
(Submitter supplied) The second leading cause of cancer death for women in the U.S. is breast cancer.  Moreover, a significant number of patients with breast tumors acquire resistance to drugs during therapy. To develop targeted therapeutic strategies to combat drug resistance it is essential to understand the basic molecular mechanisms through which cancer cells control sensitivity to chemotherapeutics. To identify new candidate genes and facilitate the discovery of novel drug resistance pathways, we have generated a resistance profile or  ?resistome? of  etoposide resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells. more...

1919. Melanoma cell culture phenotypes I
(Submitter supplied) Recent trials with MAPK inhibitors have shown promising results in many patients with metastatic melanoma; however, nearly all responding patients experience disease relapse. We describe here how melanoma cells respond to MAPK inhibition in a phenotype-specific manner, suggesting that slow cycling invasive phenotype cells provide a treatment-resistant pool from which disease relapse may be derived. The implication is that while MAPK inhibition may successfully treat proliferating cells, another cell population needs to be addressed at the same time.

(Submitter supplied) Calactin is a small molecule isolated from the Chinese herb Asclepias curassavica. We found that calactin induced DNA damage, G2/M arrest of cell cycle, and apoptosis. The calactin also increased the H2AX and Chk2 phosphorylation, which resulted in the decrease of Cdc25C and cdk1 expressions, indicating that calactin-induced G2/M arrest. Moreover, we observed that calactin-induced DNA fragmentation (DNA ladder), PARP cleavage, increase in Bad and Bax levels, and decrease in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl expressions, which results in apoptosis. more...

1953. MiR-30b/30d regulation of GalNAc transferases enhances invasion and immunosuppression during metastasis
(Submitter supplied) To metastasize, a tumor cell must acquire abilities such as the capacity to colonize new tissue and evade immune surveillance. Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs can promote the evolution of malignant behaviors by regulating multiple targets simultaneously. We performed a microRNA analysis of human melanoma, an aggressively invasive cancer, and found that miR-30b/30d upregulation correlates with stage, metastatic potential of primary tumors, shorter time to recurrence and reduced overall survival. more...

1955. BRAF Mutation Is Rare in Advanced-Stage Low-Grade Ovarian Serous Carcinomas
(Submitter supplied) Low-grade ovarian serous carcinomas are believed to arise via an adenoma-serous borderline tumor-serous carcinoma sequence. In this study, we found that advanced-stage, low-grade ovarian serous carcinomas both with and without adjacent serous borderline tumor shared similar regions of loss of heterozygosity. We then analyzed 91 ovarian tumor samples for mutations in TP53, BRAF, and KRAS. TP53 mutations were not detected in any serous borderline tumors (n = 30) or low-grade serous carcinomas (n = 43) but were found in 73% of high-grade serous carcinomas (n = 18). more...

(Submitter supplied) Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is a key phenotype associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is even present in offspring of diabetic parents. However, molecular mediators of insulin resistance remain unclear. We find that the top-ranking gene set in expression analysis of muscle from humans with T2D and normoglycemic insulin resistant subjects with parental family history (FH+) of T2D is increased expression of actin cytoskeleton genes regulated by serum response factor (SRF) and its coactivator MKL1. more...

Cancer stem cells have been described to be the only cell population with tumorogenic capacity in glioblastoma. Therefore, effective therapeutic strategies targeting these cells may be beneficial. We have established different cultures of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) derived from surgical specimens and found that, after induction of differentiation, NFκB was activated, which allows intermediate tumor precursor cells to remain cycling. more...

We found that an adenovirus encoding EGFP placed under the regulatory control of a 0.4 kb sox2 core enhancer selectively identified multipotential and self-renewing neural progenitor cells in dissociates of human fetal forebrain. Gene expression analysis of E/sox2:EGFP-sorted neural progenitor cells, normalized to the unsorted forebrain dissociates from which they derived, revealed marked overexpression of genes within the notch and wnt pathways, and identified multiple elements of each pathway that appear selective to human neural progenitors.

1989. Transcriptional effects of 1,25 dihydroxi-vitamin D3 physiological and supra-physiological concentrations in breast cancer organotypic culture
(Submitter supplied) Vitamin D may have anti-tumorigenic actions by influencing the gene expression profile of target tissues, which possess vitamin D receptors.  We used a more physiological in vitro model, represented by short-term culture of breast cancer tissue slices, to study the transcriptional effects of a near physiological concentration of calcitriol. Methods. Breast cancer fragments were sliced and maintained in culture for 24 hours in the presence or absence (control) of calcitriol 0.5nM or 100nM (called physiological or supra-physiological concentrations). more...

1991. Gene expression in IGROV1 SP and non-SP cells
(Submitter supplied) Side populations have recently been identified in ovarian cancers and may play an important role in post treatment relapse and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we aimed to identify the differential expression between IGROV1 SP and NSP on Affymetrix HG-U133plus2 microarrays. We found ovarian tumour SP cells frequently over-express the multi-drug resistance associated P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) by Rank Product (FDR<0.05), and by geneset enrichment analysis, embryonic stem cell-associated ‘NOS’ signature (Notch/Oct4/Sox2 regulated genes) and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) genes were over-expressed, while PRC2-repressed target genes were significantly under-expressed in the SP from ovarian cell lines compared to non-SP (FDR<10-4).

1998. Threshold of Biologic Response of the Small Airway Epithelium to Low Levels of Tobacco Smoke
(Submitter supplied) Background: Healthy individuals exposed to low levels of cigarette smoke have a decrement in lung function and higher risk for lung disease compared to unexposed individuals. We hypothesized that healthy individuals exposed to low levels of tobacco smoke must have biologic changes in the small airway epithelium compared to healthy unexposed individuals.   Methods: Small airway epithelium was obtained by bronchoscopy from 121 individuals; microarrays assessed genome wide gene expression, and urine nicotine and cotinine were used to categorized subjects as “nonsmokers,” “active smokers,” and “low exposure.”  The gene expression data was used to determine the threshold and ID50 of urine nicotine and cotinine at which the small airway epithelium showed abnormal responses. more...

One of these IRFs, the viral interferon regulatory factor 3 (vIRF-3) is expressed in latently infected PEL cells and required for their continuous proliferation. Moreover, vIRF-3 is known to be involved in modulation of the type I interferon response. In order to identify cellular genes regulated by vIRF-3, cells from the PEL cell line BC-3 (KSHV positive) were transfected with either siRNAs targeted at vIRF-3 (si463 or si716s) or a negative control siRNA without homology to a known gene (siN, siNs).

2049. The differentially expressed genes induced by EV71 infection
(Submitter supplied) Virus infection may shut off host protein synthesis in order to achieve the replicative advantage over host cells. It is well known that human pathogenic viruses, particularly the picornaviruses, can block host protein synthesis by cleavage or inhibition of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). In this study we found a novel mechanism that microRNA (miRNA) is involved in viral pathogenesis. Infection of enteroviruses can disturb the expression of host miRNAs, in which miR-141 is up-regulated and inhibits host protein synthesis by post-transcriptional repression of the target gene eIF4E, a key element for cap-dependent translation of host proteins. more...

2071. MEK5 is Activated by Shear Stress, Activates ERK5 And Induces KLF4 To Modulate TNF Responses in Human Dermal Microvascular Endothelial Cells
(Submitter supplied) MEK5 is activated by shear stress in large vessel endothelial cells (ECs) and contributes to the suppression of pro-inflammatory changes in the arterial wall. We used microarray analyses of total RNA from MEK5/CA-transduced HDMECs compared to LacZ control-transduced HDMECs to identify distinct classes of several regulated genes, including KLF4, eNOS, and ICAM. We conclude that MEK5 activation by shear stress may modulate inflammatory responses in the microvasculature, and these actions are partly mediated by KLF4.

(Submitter supplied) Despite timely and successful surgery, 32% of patients with bilateral and 10% with unilateral cryptorchidism will develop azoospermia. Cryptorchid boys at risk of azoospermia display a typical testicular histology of impaired mini-puberty at the time of the orchidopexy. During mini-puberty increased gonadotropin and testosterone secretion stimulate transformation of gonocytes into Ad spermatogonia. In azoospermia risk group this transformation is to a great extent impaired. This study aimed to analyze data on whole genome expression signatures of undescended testes at risk of developing azoospermia.

Our previous data demonstrated that NS1 impaired the cell-cycle progression of the CD36+ EPCs by inducing a stable G2 arrest. Microarray analysis was used to identify genes whose expressions were associated with the NS1-induced G2 arrest. A total of 1045 genes displayed a  more than 1.5-fold differential expression in the NS1-transduced cells. more...

2145. Effects of T350 phospho- on gene repression activity of EZH2
(Submitter supplied) The Polycomb group (PcG) protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) plays an essential role in histone methylation-mediated epigenetic gene silencing. We demonstrate that under physiological conditions, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and 2 (CDK2) bind to and phosphorylate EZH2 at threonine 350 (T350) in an evolutionally conserved motif. T350 phosphorylation is required for EZH2 function in silencing of genes that promote differentiation and inhibit proliferation and migration. more...

2146. Human LSD2/KDM1b/AOF1 regulates gene transcription by modulating H3K4me2 methylation (Affymetrix)
(Submitter supplied) Dynamic histone H3K4 methylation is an important epigenetic component of transcriptional regulation. However, most of our current understanding of this histone mark is confined to regulation of transcriptional initiation. We now show that human LSD2/KDM1b/AOF1, the human homolog of LSD1, is a novel H3K4me1/2 demethylase that specifically regulates histone H3K4 methylation within intragenic regions of its target genes. more...

2149. DC response to Respiratory syncytial virus from adult peripheral and cord blood
(Submitter supplied) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have suggested that T cell responses may contribute to RSV immunopathology, which could be driven by dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are productively infected by RSV, and during RSV infections, there is an increase of DCs in the lungs with a decrease in the blood. Pediatric populations are particularly susceptible to severe RSV infections, however DC responses to RSV from pediatric populations have not been examined. more...

2160. Expression data of lentivirus sponge MicroRNA16 (miR16) downregulated RPMI 8226 and MMS1 multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines compared with control lentivirus sponge
(Submitter supplied) Multiple myeloma is characterized by frequent chromosomal alterations. Deletion of chr 13, especially band 13q14, is commonly observed in early stages of MM, suggesting the presence of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) within this region. We sought to functionally validate the role of the microRNAs-15a/16 cluster, centered at the deleted region, as TSGs and delineate their downstream target genes in MM. Using “sponge” lentiviral vectors to competitive stably inhibit mature microRNAs in vitro and in vivo, we have documented enhanced proliferative and invasive capacity of cells with stably inhibition of miR-16. Expression profiling analysis of miR-16-deficient cells identified a large number of downstream target genes. This loss-of-function system, which mimics the 13q chromosomal deletion, provides a valuable tool to investigate their function in MM pathogenesis and their potential use as therapeutic targets.

2166. Gene expression differences between highly enriched normal and chronic myelogenous leukemia quiescent stem/progenitor cells and correlations with biological abnormalities
(Submitter supplied) In comparing gene expression of normal and CML CD34+ quiescent (G0) and proliferating (G1/S/G2/M) cells, 292 genes were down-regulated and 192 genes were up-regulated in the CML G0 cells. The differentially expressed genes were grouped according to their reported functions and correlations were sought with biological differences previously observed between the same groups. The most apparent correlations include: i) Normal and CML G0 cells are more primitive than G1/S/G2/M cells; ii) CML G0 cells are in a more advanced stage of development and more poised to begin proliferating than normal G0 cells; iii) When CML G0 cells are stimulated to proliferate, they undergo further differentiation and maturation more rapidly than normal G0 cells, but both granulopoiesis and erythropoiesis are less efficient than normal; iv) Whereas normal G0 cells form only granulocyte/monocyte (GM) colonies when stimulated by cytokines, CML G0 cells consistently form a combination of GM and erythroid clusters and colonies; and v) Prominin-1 (CD133) is the gene most down-regulated in CML G0 cells and its down-regulation appears to be associated with the spontaneous formation of erythroid colonies by CML progenitors without EPO. more...

(Submitter supplied) MALT lymphoma is characterized by t(11;18)(q21;q21)/API2-MALT1, t(1;14)(p22;q32)/BCL10-IGH and t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1, which commonly activate the NF-κB pathway. Gastric MALT lymphomas harboring such translocation do not respond to H. pylori eradication, while those without translocation can be cured by antibiotics. To understand the molecular mechanism of these different MALT lymphoma subgroups, we performed gene expression profiling analysis of 24 MALT lymphomas (15 translocation-positive, 9 translocation-negative). more...

2215. A cryptic sensor for HIV-1 activates antiviral innate immunity in dendritic cells
(Submitter supplied) Dendritic cells (DC) serve a key function in host defense, linking innate detection of microbes to the activation of pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses. Whether there is cell-intrinsic recognition of HIV-1 by host innate pattern-recognition receptors and subsequent coupling to antiviral T cell responses is not yet known. DC are largely resistant to infection with HIV-1, but facilitate infection of co-cultured T-helper cells through a process of trans-enhancement. more...

2217. COX-2 network as predictive molecular marker for clinical pregnancy in IVF
(Submitter supplied) CONTEXT Nowadays, the molecular mechanisms involved in endometrial receptivity and implantation are still not clear.  OBJECTIVE The gene expression of human endometrium of patients undergoing an IVF treatment with GnRH antagonists/rec-FSH was studied.  CONCLUSIONS COX-2 has been extensively studied as a crucial fertility element in both knock-out mice and human. It appears that increased expression of COX-2 and/or SCGB1D2 on the day of oocyte retrieval in GnRH antagonist/rec-FSH stimulated cycles coincides with a lower probability of achieving a clinical pregnancy in this cycle. more...

2228. Effect of Protease-resistant PML-RARα on the leukemogenic potential in a mouse model of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia
(Submitter supplied) Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that the azurophil granule protease neutrophil elastase (NE) cleaves PML-RARA (PR), the fusion protein that initiates acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Further, NE deficiency reduces the penetrance of APL in a murine model of this disease. We therefore predicted that NE-mediated PR cleavage might be important for its ability to initiate APL. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mouse expressing NE-resistant PR. more...

2328. Monocyte vs Macrophage Study
(Submitter supplied) Human intestinal macrophages contribute to tissue homeostasis in noninflamed mucosa through profound down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Here, we show that this down-regulation extends to Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine release, as intestinal macrophages expressed TLR3-TLR9 but did not release cytokines in response to TLR-specific ligands. Likely contributing to this unique functional profile, intestinal macrophages expressed markedly down-regulated adapter proteins MyD88 and Toll interleukin receptor 1 domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon beta, which together mediate all TLR MyD88-dependent and -independent NF-kappaB signaling, did not phosphorylate NF-kappaB p65 or Smad-induced IkappaBalpha, and did not translocate NF-kappaB into the nucleus. more...

2332. Gene expression discriminates chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and oncocytoma
(Submitter supplied) [original title] Genomic expression and single-nucleotide polymorphism profiling discriminates chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and oncocytoma.  Background : Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC) and renal oncocytoma are two distinct but closely related entities with strong morphologic and genetic similarities.  While chRCC is a malignant tumor, oncocytoma is usually regarded as a benign entity.  The overlapping characteristics are best explained by a common cellular origin, and the biologic differences between chRCC and oncocytoma are therefore of considerable interest in terms of carcinogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management. Previous studies have been relatively limited in terms of examining the differences between oncocytoma and chromophobe RCC. Methods : Gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix HGU133Plus2 platform was applied on chRCC (n=15) and oncocytoma specimens (n=15).  Supervised analysis was applied to identify a discriminatory gene signature, as well as differentially expressed genes.  Immunohistochemical validation was performed in an independent set of tumors. Results : A novel 14 probe-set signature was developed to classify the tumors internally with 93% accuracy, and this was successfully validated on an external data-set with 94% accuracy. Parafibromin, aquaporin 6, and synaptogyrin 3 were novel immunohistochemical markers effectively discriminating the two pathologic entities. Conclusion : Gene expression profiles and pathway analysis effectively distinguish chRCC from oncocytoma. We have generated a novel transcript predictor that is able to discriminate between the two entities accurately, and which has been validated both in an internal and an independent data-set, implying generalizability. We have identified a series of immunohistochemical markers that are clinically useful in discriminating chRCC and oncocytoma.

(Submitter supplied) 786-0 is a cell line derived from a clear cell renal carcinoma.  Previous studies have shown that the 786-O cell line harbors an inactivating mutation in the von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene.  Mutations  in the VHL gene occur in the majority of sporadic clear cell renal cell.  To determine how inactivation of the VHL affects cellular functions, we created a derivative of 786-0, which we call 786-VHL in which a functional allele of VHL has been introduced back into the 786-O cell line.

2368. Gene expression analysis in non-failing and failing myocardium pre and post pulsatile and non-pulsatile VAD support
(Submitter supplied) Mechanical unloading by ventricular assist devices (VAD) leads to significant gene-expression changes often summarized as reverse remodeling. However, little is known on individual transcriptome changes during VAD-support and its relationship to non-failing hearts (NF). In addition no data are available for the transcriptome regulation during non-pulsatile VAD-support. Therefore we analysed the gene-expression patterns of 30 paired samples from VAD-supported (including 8 non-pulsatile VADs) and 8 non-failing control hearts (NF) using the first total human genome-array available. more...

Treatment with HDACi combined with IM effectively induced apoptosis in quiescent CML progenitors resistant to elimination by IM alone, and eliminated CML stem cells capable of engrafting immunodeficient mice. In vivo administration of HDACi with IM markedly diminished LSC in a transgenic mouse model of CML. The interaction of IM and HDACi inhibited genes regulating hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and survival. more...

2370. Identification of EP4 as a Potential Target for the Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Using a Novel Xenograft Model
(Submitter supplied) More effective therapeutic approaches for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are urgently needed, thus reinforcing the need to understand how prostate tumors progress to castration resistance. We have established a novel mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer, KUCaP-2, which expresses the wild-type androgen receptor (AR) and which produces the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In this model, tumors regress soon after castration, but then reproducibly restore their ability to proliferate after 1 to 2 months without AR mutation, mimicking the clinical behavior of CRPC. more...

2374. Mitochondria regulate the unfolded protein response leading to cancer cell survival under glucose deprivation conditions
(Submitter supplied) Cancer cells consume large amounts of glucose because of their specific metabolic pathway. However, cancer cells exist in tumor tissue where glucose is insufficient. To survive, cancer cells likely have the mechanism to elude their glucose addiction. Here we show that functional mitochondria are essential if cancer cells are to avoid glucose addiction. Cancer cells with dysfunctional mitochondria, such as mitochondrial DNA-deficient rho0 cells and electron transport chain blocker-treated cells, were highly sensitive to glucose deprivation. more...

2375. CD62L expression identifies a unique subset of polyfunctional CD56dim NK cells: Groups 1-3
(Submitter supplied) Human Natural Killer (NK) cells comprise two main subsets, CD56bright and CD56dim cells, that differ in function, phenotype and tissue localization. To further dissect the heterogeneity of CD56dim cells, we have performed transcriptome analysis and functional ex vivo characterization of human NK cell subsets according to the expression of markers related to differentiation, migration or competence. Here, we show for the first time that the ability to respond to cytokines or to activating receptors is mutually exclusive in almost all NK cells with the exception of CD56dim CD62L+ cells. Indeed, only these cells combine the ability to produce interferon (IFN)-gamma after cytokines and proliferate in vivo during viral infection with the capacity to kill and produce cytokines upon engagement of activating receptors. Therefore, CD56dim CD62L+ cells represent a unique subset of polyfunctional NK cells. Ex vivo analysis of their function, phenotype, telomere length, frequencies during ageing as well as transfer experiments of NK cell subsets into immunodeficient mice suggest that CD56dim CD62L+ cells represent an intermediate stage of NK cell maturation, which after restimulation can accomplish multiple tasks and further develop into terminally differentiated effectors.

(Submitter supplied) Due to their somatic cell origin, human induced pluripotent stem cells (HiPSCs) are assumed to carry a normal diploid genome, and adaptive chromosomal aberrations have not been fully evaluated. Here, we analyzed the chromosomal integrity of 66 HiPSC and 38 human embryonic stem cell (HESC) samples from 18 different studies by global gene expression meta-analysis. We report identification of a substantial number of cell lines carrying full and partial chromosomal aberrations, half of which were validated at the DNA level. more...

(Submitter supplied) CD95 (also called FAS and APO-1) is a prototypical death receptor that regulates tissue homeostasis mainly in the immune system through induction of apoptosis. During cancer progression CD95 is frequently downregulated or cells are rendered apoptosis resistant raising the possibility that loss of CD95 is part of a mechanism for tumour evasion. However, complete loss of CD95 is rarely seen in human cancers and many cancer cells express large quantities of CD95 and are highly sensitive to CD95 mediated apoptosis in vitro. more...

(Submitter supplied) We used microarray analyses of patient myeloma cells (n=52) to correlate individual miRNA expression profiles with GEP-based risk defined by mRNA expression profilesx as well as clinical features of the disease. Unlike for mRNAs, genome-wide elevation of miRNA expression patterns were significantly positively associated with a mRNA-based GEP-risk score (P <.01) and proliferation index (P <.05). Consistent with our observation of global deregulation of miRNA expression profiles, silencing EIF2C2/AGO2, a gene component of the mRNA-based high-risk signature and a master regulator of the genesis and functionality of all miRNAs, dramatically decreased viability in myeloma cell lines.

In this study, we isolated CD207+ cells and CD3+ T cells from LCH lesions to determine cell-specific gene expression.  Compared to control epidermal CD207+ cells, the LCH CD207+ cells yielded 2113 differentially-expressed genes (FDR<0.01).  Surprisingly, expression of many genes previously associated with LCH, including cell-cycle regulators, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were not significantly different from control LCs in our study. more...

(Submitter supplied) Full title: Altered levels of MOF (member of MYST family histone acetyl transferase) and decreased levels of H4K16ac correlate with a defective DNA damage response (DDR). The human MOF gene encodes a protein that specifically acetylates histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac). Here we show that altered levels of H4K16ac correlate with a defective DNA damage response (DDR) to ionizing radiation (IR). The defect however is not due to altered expression of proteins involved in DDR. more...

2424. Gene expression profiles of myeloma cells interacting with bone marrow stromal cells in vitro
(Submitter supplied) Conventional anti-cancer drug screening is typically performed in the absence of accessory cells (e.g. stromal cells) of the tumor microenvironment, which can profoundly alter anti-tumor drug activity. To address this major limitation, we have developed assays (e.g. the tumor cell-specific in vitro bioluminescence imaging (CS-BLI) assay) to selectively quantify tumor cell viability, in presence vs. absence of non-malignant stromal cells or drug treatment. These assays have allowed us to identify that neoplastic cells from diverse malignancies exhibit stroma-induced resistance to different anti-tumor agents. In this analysis, we evaluated the molecular changes triggered in myeloma cells by their in vitro interaction with stromal cells. The transcriptional profile of 3 human multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines (MM.1S, MM.1R, INA-6) co-cultured with stromal cells vs. when cultured alone was characterized by oligonucleotide microarray analysis, using the human U133 plus 2.0 Affymetrix GeneChip.

2440. The Effect of Translocation-Induced Nuclear Re-organization on Gene Expression
(Submitter supplied) To study the effect of balanced chromosomal rearrangements on gene expression, we compared the transcriptomes of cell lines from control and t(11;22)(q23;q11) individuals. This translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 is the only recurrent constitutional non-Robertsonian translocation in humans. The number of differentially expressed transcripts between the translocated and control cohort is significantly higher than that observed between control samples alone, suggesting that balanced rearrangements have a greater effect on gene expression than normal variation. more...

2442. Indolent MCL identified by genomic and gene expression profiling
(Submitter supplied) Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive neoplasm with poor outcome. However, some patients have an indolent disease (iMCL) and may not require intensive treatment at initial diagnosis. Diagnostic criteria to recognize these patients are not available. We hypothesized that the analysis of the genetic and expression features of the tumors may help to identify patients with an indolent clinical evolution and provide biomarkers that could be used in the clinical setting.

2448. Gene expression signature reflects differentiation differences rather than telomere maintenance mechanism
(Submitter supplied) A gene expression signature purporting to distinguish between telomerase and ALT immortalization has recently been described (Lafferty-Whyte et al., 2009).  This was obtained as the intersection of two independent signatures, one obtained from cell lines and the other from a panel of liposarcomas, which utilize different telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs).   To assess the utility of this signature we used Affymetrix U133plus2.0 arrays to undertake a similar analysis of an independent collection of liposarcomas of defined TMM. more...

2457. Expression data from human neutrophils exposed to uropathogenic and commensal Esherichia coli.
(Submitter supplied) The establishment of bacterial infections at epithelial surfaces is determined by the balance of virulence attributes of the pathogen with the activity of innate host defenses.  Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are key responders in many bacterial infections, but the mechanisms by which pathogens subvert these early responses to establish infection are largely undefined.  Here, we model these early interactions between human PMN and the primary cause of urinary tract infections, namely uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). more...

2478. Expression data from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells
(Submitter supplied) Gene transfer vectors based on gamma-retroviruses target actively transcribing genes indicating that the cellular gene expression profile can be predictive of their integration pattern.  Therefore, different culture conditions leading to different transcriptional activity may translate into differences in the profile of targeted genes in cells transduced with these vectors.  Recent data from two gene therapy trials for SCID-X1 conducted in France and the UK suggested that small differences between in vitro stimulation conditions could explain the disparity in the frequency of common integrations sites observed in the two studies. more...

2517. Loss-of-function mutations in REP-1 affect intracellular vesicle transport in fibroblasts and monocytes of CHM patients
(Submitter supplied) Choroideremia (CHM) is a progressive X-linked retinopathy caused by mutations in the CHM gene, which encodes Rab escort protein-1 (REP-1), an escort protein involved in the prenylation of Rabs. Under-prenylation of certain Rabs, as a result of loss of function mutations in REP-1, could affect vesicular trafficking, exocytosis and secretion. To evaluate this hypothesis, intracellular vesicle transport, lysosomal acidification and rates of proteolytic degradation were studied in monocytes (CD14+ fraction) and primary skin fibroblasts from the nine age-matched controls and thirteen CHM patients carrying 10 different loss-of-function mutations.

(Submitter supplied) The action of RB as a tumor suppressor has been difficult to define, in part, due to the redundancy of the related proteins p107 and p130. By coupling advanced RNAi technology to suppress RB, p107 or p130 with a genome wide analysis of gene expression in growing, quiescent or ras-senescent cells, we identified a unique and specific activity of RB in repressing DNA replication as cells exit the cell cycle into senescence, a tumor suppressive program.

2595. Conditioned media from SDEC supports human embryonic stem cell proliferation on type I collagen
(Submitter supplied) Conditioned media from a human embryonic germ cell-derived line called SDEC was found to be supportive of human embryonic stem cell growth in the absence of feeder layers on a simple type I collagen matrix.  We performed gene expression studies comparing this line to non-supportive cell lines (WI-38 and Detroit 551) to try to identify gene targets responsible for this phenomenon. We used Affymetrix microarrays to identify genes that are differentially regulated in SDEC vs. more...

2596. Expression data from cytotoxic T cell clone
(Submitter supplied) T cells contribute to host-tumor interactions in patients with monoclonal gammopathies. Expansions of CD8+CD57+TCRVβ+ restricted cytotoxic T cell (CTL) clones are found in 48% of patients with multiple myeloma and confer a favorable prognosis. We now report the presence of CTL clones with varying TCRVβ repertoire in 70% of patients with Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinaemia (WM) (n=20). Previous nucleoside analogue (NA) therapy, associated with an increased incidence of transformation to aggressive lymphoma, significantly influenced the presence of TCRVβ expansions (X2=11.6; P<0.001) as 83% of patients without (n=6) and only 7% with TCRVβ expansions (n=14) had received NA. more...

2599. Expression profiling of ATRA treated NB4 cells
(Submitter supplied) NB4 is an APL derived cell line, carrying the t(15;17) translocation and expressing the PML/RARa fusion protein. Still, an important question that remains to be addressed is whether PML/RARa target genes are transcriptionally suppressed in primary APL cells and re-activated in all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treated NB4 cells. Gene expression of NB4 cells treated with ATRA at different time points were analyzed.

(Submitter supplied) Menisci play a vital role in load transmission, shock absorption and joint stability.  The current dogma is that the menisci simply protects the cartilage and play no role in osteoarthritis (OA) unless they are injured. However, there is increasing evidence suggesting that OA menisci may not merely be bystanders in the disease process of OA. This study sought: 1) to determine the prevalence of meniscal   degeneration in OA patients, 2) to examine gene expression in OA meniscal cells compared to normal control meniscal cells, and 3) to test the hypothesis that OA meniscal cells are different from normal meniscal cells. more...

2633. A Genomic Approach to Improve Prognosis and Predict Therapeutic Response in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Duke_VA)
(Submitter supplied) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous malignancy, characterized by a variable clinical course. While clinical and laboratory parameters are increasingly being used to refine prognosis, they do not accurately predict response to commonly used therapy.  We used gene expression profiling to generate and further refine prognostic and predictive markers.  Genomic signatures that reflect progressive disease and responses to chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy were created using cancer cell lines and patient leukemia samples. more...

2634. Therapeutic efficacy of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells in myocardial repair after infarction
(Submitter supplied) Human UCB-MSCs showed donor-specific variation of therapeutic efficacy in improving LV systolic function, reducing infarct area, and preserving wall thickness after MI, even though there were no significant differences in MSC phenotypes. UCB-MSCs (M02) which showed better efficacy had better paracrine activity and unique gene expression profile than others. In DNA microarray, in contrast to M01, M02 showed unique gene expression profiles; up-regulated anti-apoptotic and down-regulated apoptotic gene expression.

(Submitter supplied) We established a novel model to assess the function of proteins under in vivo conditions. The model relies on the expansion of HEK293 cells in immunodeficient NOD.Scid mice. To validate the novel model, we performed microarray gene expression profiling of NOD.Scid-expanded HEK293 cells relative to conventionally cultivated cells. Microarray analysis revealed that cell expansion in NOD.Scid mice restored an imbalanced chaperone system without inducing a major upregulation of the entire protein folding machinery.

Inclusions of TDP-43 are hallmarks of frontotemporal dementias  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Besides aggregation of TDP-43, loss of nuclear  localization is observed in disease. To identify relevant targets of TDP-43, we performed  an expression profiling study. Thereby, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) downregulation  was discovered upon TDP-43 silencing on mRNA and protein level in human embryonic  kidney HEK293E and neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. more...

2649. Genome-wide analysis of genes regulated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally by HTLV-I p30
(Submitter supplied) The Human T-cell Leukemia Virus (HTLV)-type-I non-structural protein p30 plays an important role in virus transmission and gene regulation. p30 has been documented to inhibit the export of certain viral mRNA transcripts from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This nuclear retainment of RNA molecules essentially results in gene silencing, where protein products are not produced. Considering this unique function of p30, we used microarray analysis to assess the ability of p30 to inhibit not only the regulation of transcription of cellular genes, but also the ability of p30 to regulate the export of cellular transcripts to the cytoplasm.

2711. Comparative analysis of gene regulation by the transcription factor PPARα between mouse and human
(Submitter supplied) Studies in mice have shown that PPARα is an important regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism and the acute phase response. However, little information is available on the role of PPARα in human liver. Here we set out to compare the function of PPARα in mouse and human hepatocytes via analysis of target gene regulation. Primary hepatocytes from 6 human and 6 mouse donors were treated with PPARα agonist Wy14643 and gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix GeneChips followed by a systems biology analysis. more...

2749. Comparison of post-mortem tissue from brain BA10 region between schizophrenic and control patients.
(Submitter supplied) Analysis of gene expression in two large schizophrenia cohorts identifies multiple changes associated with nerve terminal function. Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder with a world-wide prevalence of 1%. The pathophysiology of the illness is not understood, but is thought to have a strong genetic component with some environmental influences on aetiology. To gain further insight into disease mechanism, we used microarray technology to determine the expression of over 30 000 mRNA transcripts in post-mortem tissue from a brain region associated with the pathophysiology of the disease (Brodmann area 10: anterior prefrontal cortex) in 28 schizophrenic and 23 control patients.

2784. Biomarkers for Early and Late Stage Chronic Allograft Nephropathy by Genomic Profiling of Peripheral Blood
(Submitter supplied) Despite significant improvements in life expectancy of kidney transplant patients due to advances in surgery and immunosuppression, Chronic Allograft Nephropathy (CAN) remains a daunting problem. A complex network of cellular mechanisms in both graft and peripheral immune compartments complicates the non-invasive diagnosis of CAN, which still requires biopsy histology. This is compounded by non-immunological factors contributing to graft injury. more...

2785. Coordinate Control of Nrf2 Mediated Genes in the Human Small Airway Epithelium Highly Responsive to Smoking
(Submitter supplied) Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2, Nrf2) is an oxidant responsive transcription factor known to induce phase 2 detoxifying and antioxidant genes to protect cells from oxidative stress. Cigarette smoke, with its large oxidant content, is a major stressor to the small airway epithelium, the cells of which are vulnerable to oxidant damage and consequent malignant transformation. In this study, we assessed the role of cigarette smoke in activation of Nrf2 in the human small airway epithelium in vivo. more...

2787. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs): gene expression and miRNA expression data
(Submitter supplied) Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) outwardly appear to be indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). A study of gene expression profiles of mouse and human ESCs and iPSCs suggests that, while iPSCs are quite similar to their embryonic counterparts, a recurrent gene expression signature appears in iPSCs regardless of their origin or the method by which they were generated. Upon extended culture, hiPSCs adopt a gene expression profile more similar to hESCs; however, they still retain a gene expression signature unique from hESCs that extends to miRNA expression. more...

2788. Onconase Responsive Genes in Human Mesothelioma Cells: Implications for an RNA Damaging Therapeutic Agent
(Submitter supplied) Onconase represents a new class of RNA-damaging drugs. Mechanistically, Onconase is thought to internalize, where it degrades intracellular RNAs such as tRNA and double-stranded RNA, and thereby suppresses protein synthesis.  However, there may be additional or alternative mechanism(s) of action. Microarray analysis was used to compare gene expression profiles in untreated human malignant mesothelioma (MM) cell lines and cells exposed to 5 ug/ml Onconase for 24 h.

2795. Epigenetic signature of breast cancer and its association with gene expression and copy number
(Submitter supplied) Recent advances in multiple whole genome technologies provide unprecedented opportunities to profile epigenomic signatures in cancer cells. Previously we used a human gene promoter tiling microarray platform to identify genome-wide DNA methylation changes in a cell line model of breast cancer metastasis. Interestingly, the clustered nature of epigenetic targets that we identified, along with our concurrent karyotype analyses, have now led us to hypothesize that complex genomic alterations in cancer cells (deletions, translocations and ploidy) may be superimposed over promoter-specific methylation events that are responsible for gene-specific expression changes. more...

2900. Mutations of multiple genes deregulate the NF-kB pathway in diffuse large B cell lymphoma
(Submitter supplied) Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common form of lymphoma in adulthood, comprises multiple biologically and clinically distinct subtypes including germinal center B cell-like (GCB) and activated B cell like (ABC) DLBCL. Gene expression profile studies have shown that its most aggressive subtype, ABC-DLBCL, is associated with constitutive activation of the NF-kB transcription complex. However, except for a small fraction of cases, it remains unclear whether NF-kB activation in these tumors represents an intrinsic program of the tumor cell of origin or a pathogenetic event. more...

Here, we show that in response to Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), several microRNAs (miRNAs) are regulated in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Among these miRNAs, miR-155 is highly up-regulated during maturation. Using LNA silencing combined to microarray technology, we have identified the Toll-like receptor / interleukin-1 (TLR/IL-1) inflammatory pathway as a general target of miR-155. more...

2943. Global Chromatin Modifications at Enhancers Correlate with Cell Type-Specific Gene Expression in the Human Genome
(Submitter supplied) The human body is composed of diverse cell types with distinct functions. While it is known that lineage specification depends on cell specific gene expression, which in turn is driven by promoters, enhancers, insulators and other cis-regulatory DNA sequences for each gene1-3, the relative roles of these regulatory elements in this process is not clear. We have previously developed a chromatin immunoprecipitation-based microarray method (ChIP-chip) to identify promoters, enhancers and insulator elements in the human genome4-6. more...

(Submitter supplied) PDE4 inhibitors, which activate cAMP signaling by reducing cAMP catabolism, are known to induce apoptosis in B lineage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells but not normal human T cells. The explanation for such differential sensitivity remains unknown. Here, we report studies contrasting the response to PDE4 inhibitor treatment in CLL cells and normal human T and B cells. Affymetrix gene chip analysis in the three cell populations following treatment with the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram identified a set of up-regulated transcripts with unusually high fold-changes in the CLL samples, several of which are likely part of compensatory negative feedback loops. more...

2983. Regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in human cancer cells by microRNA-7
(Submitter supplied) The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in cancer and is an important therapeutic target. Aberrant expression and function of microRNAs has been associated with tumorigenesis. Bioinformatic predictions suggest that the human EGFR mRNA 3’-untranslated region contains three microRNA-7 (miR-7) target sites, which are not conserved across mammals. We found that miR-7 down-regulates EGFR mRNA and protein expression in cancer cell lines (lung, breast, and glioblastoma) via two of the three sites, inducing cell cycle arrest and cell death. more...

3133. The skeletal muscle transcript profile reflects responses to inadequate protein intake in younger and older males
(Submitter supplied) Inadequate protein intake initiates an accommodative response with adverse changes in skeletal muscle function and structure.  mRNA level changes due to short-term inadequate dietary protein might be an early indicator of accommodation.  The aims of this study were to assess the effects of dietary protein and the diet-by-age interaction on the skeletal muscle transcript profile.  Self-organizing maps were used to determine expression patterns across protein trials. more...

3169. KINK-1, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of IKKbeta, enhances susceptibility of melanoma cells to antitumoral treatment
(Submitter supplied) Interference with chemoresistance to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutics may be of great utility for cancer therapy. We have identified KINK-1 (Kinase Inhibitor of NF-kappaB-1), a highly selective small-molecule IKKkappa inhibitor, as a potent suppressor of both constitutive and induced NF-kappaB activity in melanoma cells. While KINK-1 profoundly diminished various NF-kappaB-dependent gene products regulating proliferation, cytokine production or anti-apoptotic responses, the compound by itself showed little antiproliferative or pro-apoptotic activity on the cellular level. more...

3175. Expression in HepG2 cells with overexpression of TMPRSS6 or its mutant version.
(Submitter supplied) TMPRSS6 is a type II transmembrane serine protease and is revealed by our work to be part of a low-iron sensing pathway. When animal gets iron deficient, TMPRSS6 is required to shut off hepcidin gene, so as to allow iron to be uptaken from GI tract. The mutant mouse, which was generated by ENU mutagenesis, has developed microcytic anemia. The phenotype is caused by a splicing error in Tmprss6 gene. However, the mechanism of TMPRSS6 effect remains elusive. To gain further insight into the molecular components of the TMPRSS6 signaling pathway, we overexpressed either TMPRSS6 or its mutant version of protein in human liver carcinoma cell line HepG2 cells, and compared the transcription status betweem these two treatments.

3248. Predicting prognosis using molecular profiling in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer treated with tamoxifen
(Submitter supplied) Background: Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers (BC) are heterogeneous with regard to their clinical behavior and response to therapies. The ER is currently the best predictor of response to the anti-estrogen agent tamoxifen, yet up to 30-40% of ER+BC will relapse despite tamoxifen treatment. New prognostic biomarkers and further biological understanding of tamoxifen resistance are required. more...

3284. Impact of curcumin on human monocytes (U937 cells) exposed to oxidative stress
(Submitter supplied) Oxidative stress as a result of cigarette smoking is an important etiological factor in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a chronic steroid-insensitive inflammatory disease of the airways. The activity of the transcriptional co-repressor Histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) is dramatically reduced in COPD and cells exposed to oxidative stress or cigarette smoke. Moreover, curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a dietary polyphenol, at concentrations upto 1uM specifically restores cigarette smoke extract (CSE)- or oxidative stress- impaired HDAC2 activity. more...

3285. The effect of the HDAC inhibitor OSU-HDAC42 on gene expression in esophageal tissues and adenocarcinoma cells I
(Submitter supplied) Title: In vitro and in vivo effects of the orally bioavailable phenylbutyrate-derived histone deacetylase inhibitor OSU-HDAC42 on gene expression in esophageal tissues and in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate nucleosomal packaging of DNA, thereby influencing gene transcription and multiple cancer-associated processes. Thus, we conducted microarray analysis at multiple time-points to assess the ability of OSU-HDAC42, the S enantiomer of the previously published compound HDAC-42,  to modulate key acid-induced changes as well as to impact other genes altered as the normal esophageal epithelium progresses along the metaplasia-dysplasia-esophageal adenocarcinoma continuum. more...

3286. Expression data of hormone-responsive MCF-7 cells versus estrogen-deprived MCF-7:5C and MCF-7:2A breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen deprivation using aromatase inhibitors is currently the standard of care for patients with estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Unfortunately, prolonged estrogen deprivation leads to drug resistance (i.e. hormone-independent growth). We therefore used DNA microarray analysis to study the gene expression profiles of wild-type MCF-7 cells (which are sensitive to antihormone therapy) and long-term estrogen deprived MCF-7:5C and MCF-7:2A breast cancer cells (which are resistance to estrogen-deprivation; aromatase inhibitor resistant). more...

(Submitter supplied) The bone marrow microenvironment is a complex mixture of cells that function in concert to regulate hematopoiesis. Cellular components include fixed nonhematopoietic stromal elements as well as monocytes and resident macrophages, which are derived from the hematopoietic stem cells. Although these monocyte-lineage cells are reported to modify stromal cell function, the reverse also occurs.  Given the secretory capability of the monocyte/macrophage and their various potential functions, it is not surprising that stromal cells contained within a particular niche can modify monocyte gene expression and functional  maturation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Following androgen ablation therapy (AAT), the vast majority of prostate cancer patients develop treatment resistance with a median time of 18-24 months to disease progression. To identify molecular targets that aid in prostate cancer cell survival and contribute to the androgen independent phenotype, we evaluated changes in LNCaP cell gene expression during 12 months of androgen deprivation. At time points reflecting critical growth and phenotypic changes, we performed Affymetrix expression array analysis to examine the effects of androgen deprivation during the acute response, during the period of apparent quiescence, and during the emergence of highly proliferative, androgen-independent prostate cancer cells (LNCaP-AI). more...

Many studies suggest a significant role for chronic CD4(+) T cell activation. We assumed that the pathogenic process of excessive CD4(+) T cell activation would be reflected in the transcriptional profiles of activated CD4(+) T cells.

When the cells from either group were cultured in medium promoting differentiation towards cells of the osteo/odontoblastic lineage, both became alkaline phosphatase positive, produced calcified matrix, and were also capable of forming dentin-like matrix on scaffolds in vivo. more...

3409. Plasmodium Circumsporozoite Protein Promotes the Development of the Liver Stages of the Parasite
(Submitter supplied) The liver stages of malaria sporozoites develop in the hepatocyte cytoplasm inside a parasitophorous vacuole (PV). The circumsporozoite (CS) protein, the major surface protein of sporozoites, traverses the PV membrane and enters the cytoplasm and nucleus of hepatocytes. CS export into the cytoplasm requires the presence of pexel/VTS motifs. The transport of CS into the host nucleus is then mediated by importin (Imp) alpha3/beta1 that binds to the nuclear localization signal of CS localized in the conserved region II-plus. more...

3434. Domain-Wide Regulation of Gene Expression in the Human Genome
(Submitter supplied) Transcription factor complexes bind to regulatory sequences of genes, providing a system of individual expression regulation. Targets of distinct transcription factors usually map throughout the genome, without clustering. Nevertheless, highly and weakly expressed genes do cluster in separate chromosomal domains with an average size of  80 to 90 genes. We therefore asked whether, besides transcription factors, an additional level of gene expression regulation exists that acts on chromosomal domains. more...

3471. Fetal cartilage selective genes identified in a genome-scale analysis
(Submitter supplied) Cartilage plays a fundamental role in the development of the human skeleton. Early in embryogenesis, mesenchymal cells condense and differentiate to chondrocytes to shape the early skeleton. Subsequently, the cartilage anlagen differentiate to form the growth plates, which are responsible for linear bone growth, and the articular chondrocytes, which facilitate joint function. However, despite the multiplicity of roles of cartilage during human fetal life, surprisingly little is known about its transcriptome. more...

Here we characterize the molecular basis of signalling through DC-SIGN by large-scale gene expression profiling and phosphoproteome analysis. Solitary DC-SIGN activation leads to a phenotypically disparate transcriptional program from Toll-like receptor (TLR) triggering with downregulation of MHC II, CD86, and interferon response genes and with induction of the TLR negative regulator ATF3. more...

3508. Dendritic Cells Compare the Similarity of Endogenous and Exogenous Antigens
(Submitter supplied) Here we demonstrate by the use of extensive controls and stringent statistical analysis that dendritic cells differentially regulate hundreds of different genes based upon sequence similarity of endogenously- and exogenously-loaded antigens and in a T-cell independent fashion.  When endogenously and exogenously-derived antigens are identical, dendritic cells upregulate many different components of the Th-1 response, favoring the priming of CD8+ effectors and promulgating cellular immunity. more...

(Submitter supplied) The nuclear LIM-only protein LMO4 is upregulated in breast cancer, especially estrogen receptor negative tumors, and its overexpression in mice leads to hyperplasia and tumor formation. Here, we show that deletion of LMO4 in the mammary glands of mice leads to impaired lobuloalveolar development due to decreased epithelial cell proliferation. With the goal of discovering potential LMO4-target genes, we also developed a conditional expression system in MCF-7 cells for both LMO4 and a dominant negative (DN) form of its co-regulator, Co-factor of LIM domains (Clim/Ldb/Nli). more...

3547. IFN-gamma alters the response of Borrelia burgdorferi-activated endothelium to favor chronic inflammation
(Submitter supplied) Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, promotes pro-inflammatory changes in endothelium that lead to the recruitment of leukocytes. The host immune response to infection results in increased levels of IFN-gamma in the serum and lesions of Lyme disease patients that correlate with greater severity of disease. Therefore, the effect of IFN-gamma on the gene expression profile of primary human endothelial cells exposed to B. more...

3548. A Genome-wide Screen for Hypermethylated Genes in Lung Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Abstract Background:  Promoter hypermethylation coupled with loss of heterozygosity at the same locus results in loss of gene function in many tumor cells.  The “rules” governing which genes are methylated during the pathogenesis of individual cancers, how specific methylation profiles are initially established, or what determines tumor-type specific methylation are unknown.  However, DNA methylation markers that are highly specific and sensitive for common tumors would be useful for the early detection of cancer, and those required for the malignant phenotype identify pathways important as therapeutic targets. more...

3551. Simvastatin has an anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages via upregulation of Kruppel-like factor-2
(Submitter supplied) HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, have beneficial vascular effects beyond their cholesterol-lowering action. These pleiotropic effects include an anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages. Since macrophages play a central role in atherogenesis, we further characterized the effects on peripheral blood monocyte-macrophages (HPBM). Using Affymetrix gene chip analysis of simvastatin-treated HPBM, we found that simvastatin treatment lead to the downregulation of the expression of many proinflammatory genes including several chemokines (e.g. more...

(Submitter supplied) In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) NOTCH 1 receptors are frequently mutated. This leads to aberrantly high Notch signaling, but how this translates into deregulated cell cycle control and the transformed cell type is poorly understood. In this report, we analyze downstream responses resulting from the high level of NOTCH 1 signaling in T-ALL. Notch activity, measured immediately downstream of the NOTCH 1 receptor, is high, but expression of the canonical downstream Notch response genes HES 1 and HEY 2 is low both in primary cells from T-ALL patients and in T-ALL cell lines. more...

How such exit is achieved and how cells transmigrate the distinct endothelium of lymphatic vessels is however unknown. Here we show that inflammatory cytokines trigger activation of dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) leading to expression of the key leukocyte adhesion receptors ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin, as well as a discrete panel of chemokines and other potential regulators of leukocyte transmigration. more...

(Submitter supplied) Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2, encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2. MeCP2 is a transcriptional repressor elevated in mature neurons and is predicted to be required for neuronal maturation by regulating multiple target genes. Identifying primary gene targets in either Mecp2-deficient mice or human RTT brain has proven to be difficult, perhaps because of the transient requirement for MeCP2 during neuronal maturation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Meningiomas are typically considered a benign tumor that can be cured by complete surgical resection; however, a percentage of patients have recurrent disease, even after apparently complete resections. These patients require additional surgeries, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of all three. The ability to recognize these patients prior to recurrence would promote earlier use of adjuvant therapy, thus improving overall patient outcome. more...

(Submitter supplied) Parkinson's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no cure.  The cause of PD symptoms is loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain, but it is not known why these neurons die.  Pesticide exposure is epidemiologically associated with PD, and administration of the organic pesticide rotenone to rats recapitulates most of the behavioral, neurochemical, and neuropathological findings in PD, including specific death of dopamine neurons. more...

3627. Expression data from p63 siRNA in squamous cell lines
(Submitter supplied) p63, a homologue of the tumor suppressor p53, is critical for the development and maintenance of squamous epithelia.  p63 is specifically expressed in the basal layers of stratified epithelial tissues, and is considered to be a specific marker for cells of this type.  The role of p63 in tumorigenesis remains poorly defined.  Numerous studies have highlighted the oncogenic potential of the predominant p63 isoform, ΔNp63α; however, data suggests that other p63 proteins can act as tumor suppressors or alter the metastatic potential of tumors. more...

(Submitter supplied) Our goal was to assess gene expression changes that occur when Lymphoid Enhancer Factor-1 (LEF-1) promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the primary mechanism of tumor metastasis. To observe this phenomenon without interference from other signaling pathways, we selected DLD1 colon carcinoma cells (ATCC) which contain a mutation in APC. APC is a necessary component of a ubiquitin protein complex (including GSK-3beta, Axin, etc.) that is responsible for degrading cytoplasmic beta-catenin. more...

3633. Expression profiling of leukemia cell lines
(Submitter supplied) Methylation of CpG islands is associated with transcriptional repression and, in cancer, leads to the abnormal silencing of tumor-suppressor genes. Genome wide methylation profiling of myeloid leukemia cell lines identified a large number of genes with aberrantly methylated CpG islands. Comparative mRNA expression analysis suggests that more than half of these genes show extremely low or absent expression in normal cells, suggesting that hypermethylation in cancer may be independent of the transcriptional status of the affected gene. more...

(Submitter supplied) Meningiomas are typically considered a benign tumor that can be cured by complete surgical resection; however, a percentage of patients have recurrent disease, even after apparently complete resections.  These patients require additional surgeries, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of all three.  The ability to recognize these patients prior to recurrence would promote earlier use of adjuvant therapy, thus improving overall patient outcome. more...

(Submitter supplied) Our laboratory has developed the first mouse model overexpressing a RNA-binding protein, the ELAV-like protein HuD, in the CNS under the control of the CaMKinII alpha promoter. Initial behavioral characterization of the mice revealed that they had significant learning deficits together with abnormalities in prepulse inhibition (PPI). At the molecular level, we found that the expression of the growth-associated protein GAP-43, one of the targets of HuD, was increased in the hippocampus of HuD transgenic mice. more...

(Submitter supplied) Schwann cells, expanded in number by exposure to growth factors in vitro, could be useful in nervous system repair. Our previous results suggest that long term exposure to heregulin and forskolin changes the functional properties of the human Schwann cells, including the ability to myelinate axons after transplantation. Here, we propose to determine the molecular changes in the Schwann cells that occur as a result of extended growth with mitogenic factors. more...

3668. The role of micro-RNA genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma
(Submitter supplied) We show that numerous miRNAs are transcriptionally up-regulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tumors compared with unaffected thyroid tissue.  Among the predicted target genes of the three most upregulated miRNAs (miRs 221, 222 and 146b), only less than 15% showed significant downexpression in transcript level between tumor and unaffected tissue.  The KIT gene which is known to be downregulated by miRNAs 221 and 222 displayed dramatic loss of transcript and protein in those tumors that had abundant mir-221, mir-222, and mir-146b transcript. more...

3669. Wavelet modelling of microarray data provides chromosomal pattern of expression which predicts survival in gliomas
(Submitter supplied) Genetic and epigenetic processes result in gene expression changes through alteration of the chromatin structure.  The relative position of genes on chromosomes has therefore important functional implications and can be exploited to model microarray datasets.  Gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumours in adults and their prognosis is related to histology and grade.  In  oligodendrogliomas, allelic loss of 1p/19q and hypermethylation of MGMT promoter is associated with longer survival and chemosensitivity. more...

3670. Hypoxic regulation of gene expression is dominated by the HIF system and can be mimicked by DMOG
(Submitter supplied) The response of cells to hypoxia is characterised by co-ordinated regulation of many genes. Studies of the regulation of the expression of many of these genes by oxygen has implicated a role for the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). The mechanism of oxygen sensing which controls this heterodimeric factor is via oxygen dependent prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation by specific 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (PHD1, PHD2, PHD3 and FIH-1). more...
